{"disease_name": "Melanoma", "url": "https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1058445-overview", "title": "Melanocytic Nevi", "question": "Sex", "answer": "No clear sex predilection is reported for the development of melanocytic nevi. However, melanocytes have been postulated to exhibit some degree of sex hormone responsiveness. The findings associated with melanocytic nevi during pregnancy support this conclusion. Melanocytic nevi commonly darken and/or enlarge during pregnancy. Melanocytes have been shown to have cytosolic receptors for estrogens and androgens, and melanogenesis is responsive to these steroid hormones. Some melanomas seem to respond to hormones, an observation that might be explained by these cytosolic receptors. Subtle differences may exist in the prevalence of melanocytic nevi between women and men. Judging the incidence and prevalence based on available biopsy data is difficult because women may be more likely to seek medical attention. If sex-specific variations in incidence do exist, the differences may be site specific. For example, specific histopathological features are commonly observed in melanocytic nevi that occur within genital skin. These features are noted almost exclusively within biopsy specimens from women, although similar alterations can occasionally be observed in melanocytic nevi from males. From the author's database (at the University of California, San Francisco), data clearly show that biopsies of genital melanocytic nevi are much more commonly performed in women than in men. These data do not unequivocally confirm that the prevalence of genital melanocytic nevi is truly increased in women, although this seems likely."}

Though artificial intelligence classification algorithms have achieved expert-level performance in controlled studies examining single images, in practice dermatologists base their judgment holistically from multiple lesions on the same patient. The 2020 SIIM-ISIC Melanoma Classification challenge dataset described herein was constructed to address this discrepancy between prior challenges and clinical practice, providing for each image in the dataset an identifier allowing lesions from the same patient to be mapped to one another. This patient-level contextual information is frequently used by clinicians to diagnose melanoma and is especially useful in ruling out false positives in patients with many atypical nevi. The dataset represents 2,056 patients (20.8% with at least one melanoma, 79.2% with zero melanomas) from three continents with an average of 16 lesions per patient, consisting of 33,126 dermoscopic images and 584 (1.8%) histopathologically confirmed melanomas compared with benign melanoma mimickers.

Acquired melanocytic naevi are given a variety of names and there is considerable overlap of descriptions. Signature naevi are the predominant group of naevi in an individual with multiple moles. Solid brown naevus | Solid pink naevus | Eclipse naevus | Cockade naevus ---|---|---|--- Solid brown naevi have uniform brown pigmentation. | Solid pink naevi are seen in fair-skinned individuals and lack melanin pigmentation. | Eclipse naevus has a ring, or segment of a ring, of darker pigment around a tan or pink centre. Often found in the scalp. | Cockade, or naevus en cocarde/cockade, has a central dark naevus surrounded by concentric circles of light and dark pigmentation like a rosette. Naevus with perifollicular hypopigmentation | Fried-egg naevus | Lentiginous naevus | Naevus with eccentric pigmentation ---|---|---|--- Naevi with perifollicular hypopigmentation have white spots around each hair. Easier to see by dermoscopy. | Fried-egg naevus is a compound naevus with a flat rim of pigment around a bumpy central portion – the bump can be lighter or darker than the pigmented rim. | Lentiginous naevi are small, dark brown or black, flat lesions, often with a slightly paler rim – people with multiple lentiginous naevi have been said to have cheetah phenotype. | The Bolognia sign refers to a harmless, small area of darker colour on one side of the naevus. Uncommon types of melanocytic naevi include: * Reed naevus: darkly pigmented type of Spitz naevus with starburst dermatoscopic pattern * Agminated naevi: a cluster of similar moles * Kissing naevus: adjacent melanocytic naevi on upper and lower eyelids, due to naevus formation prior to separation of eyelids _in utero._ * A melanocytic naevus with specific characteristics: large (> 5 mm); ill-defined or irregular borders; varying shades of colour; with flat and bumpy components. * Or, any funny-looking naevus; large, or different from the patient’s other naevi. Atypical naevi usually occur in fair-skinned individuals and are due to sun exposure. They may be solitary or numerous.

This study aimed to demonstrate the concordance and discordance between clinical and histopathological diagnoses of melanocytic nevi and the importance of histological evaluation in differentiating malignant lesions from diseases with similar clinical manifestations. **Patients and Methods:** We studied 4,561 consecutive patients with a clinical diagnosis of melanocytic nevi from 2014 to 2019. We compared the clinical diagnosis with the histopathological diagnosis to establish a histopathological concordance rate and then investigated the effects of clinical characteristics and the reasons for removal on misclassification. **Results:** Among 4,561 patients who were clinically diagnosed with melanocytic nevi, the overall histopathological concordance rate was 82.11% (3,745 of 4,561 patients), while the histopathological discordance rate was 17.89% (816 of 4,561 patients). The histopathological concordance included 90.25% common acquired melanocytic nevi (3,380 of 3,745 patients) and 9.75% other benign melanocytic neoplasms (365 of 3,745 patients). The most common diagnostic change was to seborrheic keratosis (_n_ = 470, 10.30%), followed by basal cell carcinoma (_n_ = 64, 1.40%), vascular tumor (_n_ = 53, 1.16%), fibroma (_n_ = 43, 0.94%), epidermoid cyst (_n_ = 34, 0.75%), wart (_n_ = 30, 0.66%), melanoma (_n_ = 24, 0.53%), Bowen's disease (_n_ = 16, 0.35%), squamous cell carcinoma (_n_ = 4, 0.09%), keratoacanthoma (_n_ = 2, 0.04%), and other neoplasms (_n_ = 76, 1.67%). Male sex, old age, location of the lesion, and the reasons for removal have a potential effect on misclassification. The percentages of misclassified lesions on the trunk and limbs and the perineum and buttocks were higher than those in lesions without a change in diagnosis. Importantly, locations of lesions on the head and neck were significantly related to a change in diagnosis to non-melanoma skin cancer, while locations on the hands and feet were significantly related to a change in diagnosis to melanoma. In addition to a typical clinical features, removal due to lesion changes or repeated stimulation was significantly associated with a change in diagnosis to melanoma. **Conclusions:** Our study emphasizes the clinical differential diagnosis of melanocytic nevi, especially the possibility of malignant tumors. The occurrence of clinical features associated with clinicopathological discordance should raise the clinical suspect and be carefully differentiated from malignant tumors. **Keywords:** melanocytic nevi, melanocytic diseases, melanoma, diagnosis, misclassification"}

In this review, we discuss the genetics of nevi by salient nevi subtypes: congenital melanocytic nevi, acquired melanocytic nevi, blue nevi, and Spitz nevi. While the molecular etiology of nevi has been less thoroughly studied than melanoma, it is clear that nevi and melanoma share common driver mutations. Acquired melanocytic nevi harbor oncogenic mutations in _BRAF_ , which is the predominant oncogene associated with melanoma. Congenital melanocytic nevi and blue nevi frequently harbor _NRAS_ mutations and _GNAQ_ mutations, respectively, while Spitz and atypical Spitz tumors often exhibit _HRAS_ and kinase rearrangements. These initial “driver” mutations are thought to trigger the establishment of benign nevi. After this initial phase of cell proliferation, a senescence program is executed, causing termination of nevi growth. Only upon the emergence of additional tumorigenic alterations, which may provide an escape from oncogene-induced senescence, can malignant progression occur. Here, we review the current literature on the pathobiology and genetics of nevi in the hope that additional studies of nevi promise to inform our understanding of the transition from benign neoplasm to malignancy. **Keywords:** congenital melanocytic nevi, acquired melanocytic nevi, Spitz nevi, blue nevi, genetics"}

We tackle this problem by releasing the HAM10000 (“Human Against Machine with 10000 training images”) dataset. We collected dermatoscopic images from different populations acquired and stored by different modalities. Given this diversity we had to apply different acquisition and cleaning methods and developed semi-automatic workflows utilizing specifically trained neural networks. The final dataset consists of 10015 dermatoscopic images which are released as a training set for academic machine learning purposes and are publicly available through the ISIC archive. This benchmark dataset can be used for machine learning and for comparisons with human experts. Cases include a representative collection of all important diagnostic categories in the realm of pigmented lesions. More than 50% of lesions have been confirmed by pathology, while the ground truth for the rest of the cases was either follow-up, expert consensus, or confirmation by in-vivo confocal microscopy. **Subject terms:** Cancer screening, Squamous cell carcinoma, Melanoma, Basal cell carcinoma, Cancer imaging"}

Histopathologic reports were matched manually to specific lesions. From a series of multiple sequential images of the same nevus we extracted only the most recent one. Some melanomas of this set were also photographed with a DermLiteTM FOTO (3GenTM) camera. These additional images became also part of the ViDIR image series, where different images of the same lesion were labeled with a common identifier string. Original images of the MoleMax HD system had a resolution of 1872x1053px (MoleMax HD) with non-quadratic pixels. We manually cropped all MoleMax HD images to 800x600px (72DPI), centered the lesion if necessary, and reverted the format to quadratic pixels."}

The histopathologic expression \"superficial spreading melanoma in situ, arising in a preexisting dermal nevus\", for example, should only be allocated to the \"melanoma\" class and not to the nevus class. The seven generic classes were chosen for simplicity and in regard of the intended use as a benchmark dataset for the diagnosis of pigmented lesions by humans and machines. The seven classes covered more than 95% of all pigmented lesions examined in daily clinical practice of the two study sites.

The Austrian image set consists of lesions of patients referred to a tertiary European referral center specialized for early detection of melanoma in high risk groups. This group of patients often have a high number of nevi and a personal or family history of melanoma. The Australian image set includes lesions from patients of a primary care facility in a high skin cancer incidence area. Australian patients are typified by severe chronic sun damage. Chronic sun damaged skin is characterized by multiple solar lentigines and ectatic vessels, which are often present in the periphery of the target lesion. Very rarely also small angiomas and seborrheic keratoses may collide with the target lesion. We did not remove this \"noise\" and we also did not remove terminal hairs because it reflects the situation in clinical practice. In most cases, albeit not always, the target lesion is in the center of the image. Dermatoscopic images of both study sites were taken by different devices using polarized and non-polarized dermatoscopy. The set includes representative examples of pigmented skin lesions that are practically relevant. More than 95% of all lesion encountered during clinical practice will fall into one of the seven diagnostic categories. In practice, the task of the clinician is to differentiate between malignant and benign lesions, but also to make specific diagnoses because different malignant lesions, for example melanoma and basal cell carcinoma, may be treated in a different way and timeframe. With the exception of vascular lesions, which are pigmented by hemoglobin and not by melanin, all lesions have variants that are completely devoid of pigment (for example amelanotic melanoma). Non-pigmented lesions, which are more diverse and have a larger number of possible differential diagnoses, are not part of this set. The following description of diagnostic categories is meant for computer scientists who are not familiar with the dermatology literature:"}

Images in the dataset may diverge from those an end-user, especially lay persons, would provide in a real-world scenario. For example, insufficiently magnified images of small lesions or out of focus images were removed. We used automated screening by neural networks, multiple manual reviews and cleared EXIF-data of the images to remove any potentially identifiable information. Data can thus be regarded anonymized to the best of our knowledge and the data collection was approved by the ethics review committee at the Medical University of Vienna and the University of Queensland."}

{"disease_name": "Melanoma", "url": "https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8544364/", "title": "Epidemiology of Melanoma", "question": "Abstract", "answer": "Melanoma accounts for 1.7% of global cancer diagnoses and is the fifth most common cancer in the US. Melanoma incidence is rising in developed, predominantly fair-skinned countries, growing over 320% in the US since 1975. However, US mortality has fallen almost 30% over the past decade with the approval of 10 new targeted or immunotherapy agents since 2011. Mutations in the signaling-protein BRAF, present in half of cases, are targeted with oral BRAF/MEK inhibitor combinations, while checkpoint inhibitors are used to restore immunosurveillance likely inactivated by UV radiation. Although the overall 5-year survival has risen to 93.3% in the US, survival for stage IV disease remains only 29.8%. Melanoma is most common in white, older men, with an average age of diagnosis of 65. Outdoor UV exposure without protection is the main risk factor, although indoor tanning beds, immunosuppression, family history and rare congenital diseases, moles, and obesity contribute to the disease. Primary prevention initiatives in Australia implemented since 1988, such as education on sun-protection, have increased sun-screen usage and curbed melanoma incidence, which peaked in Australia in 2005. In the US, melanoma incidence is not projected to peak until 2022–2026. Fewer than 40% of Americans report practicing adequate protection (sun avoidance from 10 a.m.–4 p.m. and regular application of broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF > 30). A 2-4-fold return on investment is predicted for a US sun-protection education initiative. Lesion-directed skin screening programs, especially for those at risk, have also cost-efficiently reduced melanoma mortality. **Keywords:** melanoma, epidemiology, incidence, mortality, prevention, risk factors"}

Conclusions", "answer": "Melanoma is a leading cancer diagnosis in the developed world and is projected to continue to increase in incidence over the coming decades. Mortality rates have fallen thanks to advances in targeted and immunotherapies, though those diagnosed with stage IV disease still have a dismal survival rate. Prevention remains essential for reducing healthcare costs and minimizing morbidity and mortality. Risk factors such as UV exposure without broad-spectrum sunscreen or other protection, indoor tanning, immunosuppression, and obesity are primary targets for educational programs, which have been highly effective in decreasing melanoma incidence in Australia. Screening is recommended for those with risk factors such as family or prior history, congenital diseases, predisposing lifestyle/occupation, and high-risk demographics, in particular older, white men."}

Khối u hắc tố xâm lấn nguy hiểm hơn, một khi chúng đã thâm nhập sâu hơn vào da, chúng có thể lan ra các khu vực khác của cơ thể. Dạng phổ biến nhất là ung thư hắc tố lan trên bề mặt (**Superficial spreading melanoma**), chiếm 70% ca bệnh và thường gặp ở những người trẻ tuổi. Trong một khoảng thời gian khá dài, khối u phát triển tại các lớp da trên cùng trước khi thâm nhập sâu hơn. Dấu hiệu đầu tiên là sự xuất hiện của một mảng da phẳng hoặc hơi lồi có màu thay đổi và có viền bất bình thường. Đây là loại u ác tính có thể hình thành từ một nốt ruồi lành tính. Ung thư hắc tố lentigo (**Lentigo maligna**) tương tự như dạng 1 vì nó cũng xuất hiệngần với bề mặt da trong một khoảng thời gian. Đây là dạng ung thư hắc tố tại chỗ thường thấy nhất ở người già, phát sinh sau thời gian dài tiếp xúc với ánh nắng, da bị hư hỏng trên mặt, tai, tay và thân trên. Dạng 3 **Acral lentiginousmelanoma** cũng xuất hiện trên bề mặt trước khi thâm nhập sâu hơn. Dấu hiệu gồm có sự đổi màu đen hoặc nâu dưới móng tay hoặc lòng bàn tay, bàn chân. Bệnh thường tiến nhanh hơn so với hai dạng bệnh đầu. Đây là loại khối u hắc tố thường gặp nhất ở người Mỹ gốc Phi và người châu Á, đôi khi được tìm thấy ở người da đen và ít gặp ở người da trắng. Dạng 4 Ung thư hắc tố dạng nốt **(Nodular melanoma****)** thường đã di căn tại thời điểm chẩn đoán. Các khối u có dạng vết sưng màu đen, màu xanh, xám, trắng, nâu, nâu, đỏ hoặc màu da. U xuất hiện ở thân, chân và cánh tay, chủ yếu là ở người cao tuổi và nó cũng có thể có da đầu ở nam giới. Đây là dạng phức tạp nhất và được tìm thấy trong 10 đến 15% các trường hợp."}

Phẫu thuật để lại sẹo nhỏ và cải thiện theo thời gian bằng cách sử dụng mỹ phẩm phù hợp. Phẫu thuật cắt bỏ (**Surgical excision**) sử dụng điều trị tất cả các dạng ung thư da. Đây là phương pháp cho hiệu quả y học cũng như thẩm mỹ. Các bác sĩ bắt đầu bằng việc khoanh vùng các khối u với một cây bút đánh dấu và sau đótiến hành gây tê cục bộ và cắt dọc theo đường đã vẽ. Toàn bộ quy trình mất khoảng ba mươi phút cho các tổn thương nhỏ hơn. Vết thương lành nhanh chóng, thường là trong một hoặc hai tuần. Sẹo hình thành phụ thuộc vào nhiều yếu tố, bao gồm vị trí của khối u và quá trình chăm sóc bệnh nhân sau phẫu thuật. Các mẫu mô này sẽ được gửi đến một phòng thí nghiệm, để kiểm tra liệu \"ngưỡng an toàn\" có bị xâm chiếm bởi khối u. Nếu trường hợp này xảy ra, rất có thể khối u vẫn còn hiện diện, và cần phẫu thuật bổ sung. Đôi khi, phẫu thuật Mohs micrographic là một lựa chọn tốt vào thời điểm này."}

However, in cases where SK presenting as multiple skin-colored or clustered lesions can be easily misdiagnosed as verruca plana (VP), especially in the young population. This retrospective study investigated the prevalence of SK and VP in the lesions that appear clinically similar to VP according to age. We examined the pathology slides of the skin tissue and photographs of patients who were clinically suspected to have VP. A total of 503 patients were included in the study, out of which 174 patients were finally diagnosed with SK (34.6%) and 132 with VP (26.2%). The mean ages of the SK- and VP-diagnosed group were 39.3 and 35.4 years, respectively. SK had a higher prevalence among individuals older than 30 years, and relative frequency of SK should not be ignored in patients with a grouped distribution in their 20 s and 30 s. Therefore, our study suggests that multiple verrucous skin-colored to brownish plaques are also commonly diagnosed as SK in young people as well as VP, and the prevalence of SK and VP may not always depend solely on chronological aging, and the prevalence of SK among young people may be higher than commonly believed stereotypes suggest."}

If the patient is female, or if the lesion is on the face, less than 3 mm in size, has a brownish color, and is distributed in a scattered pattern, the likelihood of diagnosis of SK increases. Among patients with SK and VP, the average ages at the time of diagnosis were 39.3 and 35.4 years, respectively. In addition, the 30–39 age group showed a higher proportion of SK-diagnosed cases than VP-diagnosed cases. Both SK-diagnosed- and VP-diagnosed cases showed a similar prevalence in the 20–29 age group. These findings suggested that clinically presented VP-like lesions were mostly SK, and the prevalence proportion of SK should not be ignored in patients in their 1920s and 1930s. \\(2000\\).\"). They suggested that SK is also common in young people, and that the term senile keratosis, another term for SK, was no longer appropriate. \\(2020\\).\"). Furthermore, although VP usually requires treatment because of high risk of transmission to others, SK does not cause medical problems other than cosmetic concerns. Therefore, differentiation between these two diseases is required to relieve the patients from unnecessary distress and for medical counseling. \\(2021\\).\"). Thus, unexpected development of SK in young patients may be caused by accelerated cellular senescence, rather than their chronological age. Further studies are needed to identify the association with pathogenesis of SK and cellular senescence. Our study had several limitations. The study population did not include all VP-like lesions. Also, there may is a potential risk of selection bias, as the included patients were those who underwent biopsies, possibly indicating the presence of atypical VP-like lesions. However, since we included all cases in which biopsy was performed with the clinical impression of both SK and VP, we believe that our results are still meaningful because this study enrolled all cases in which biopsy was necessary to confirm the diagnosis of VP-like lesions, owing to the difficulty in differentiating between the two diseases. In addition, the study was conducted through a retrospective review of clinical photographs and electronic medical records and included patients from a single tertiary center. Finally, due to the limitations of the retrospective study design, we were unable to investigate the patients' Fitzpatrick skin type. This limitation prevented us from accurately reflecting the patients' UV exposure or skin color. In the present study, we observed that lesions clinically diagnosed as VP in young adults were also commonly diagnosed as SK. Despite the common conception that SK is diagnosed mostly in the elderly, we suggest that SK can occur in individuals of all age groups. As patients could suffer from unnecessary anxiety assuming the spread of the virus, we think our observations will be helpful in reassuring young patients with lesions that may be confused with VP, such as multiple, grouped, or skin-colored lesions."}
