Melanoma,https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1058445-overview,Melanocytic Nevi,Race,"Melanocytic nevi are common lesions in patients with light or fair skin and are less common lesions in dark-skinned individuals. This difference in prevalence is in part attributable to the fact that identifying moles in dark-skinned patients is often difficult, especially if the lesions are macular (flat)."
Melanoma,https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1058445-overview,Melanocytic Nevi,Sex,"No clear sex predilection is reported for the development of melanocytic nevi. However, melanocytes have been postulated to exhibit some degree of sex hormone responsiveness. The findings associated with melanocytic nevi during pregnancy support this conclusion. Melanocytic nevi commonly darken and/or enlarge during pregnancy. Melanocytes have been shown to have cytosolic receptors for estrogens and androgens, and melanogenesis is responsive to these steroid hormones. Some melanomas seem to respond to hormones, an observation that might be explained by these cytosolic receptors. Subtle differences may exist in the prevalence of melanocytic nevi between women and men. Judging the incidence and prevalence based on available biopsy data is difficult because women may be more likely to seek medical attention. If sex-specific variations in incidence do exist, the differences may be site specific. For example, specific histopathological features are commonly observed in melanocytic nevi that occur within genital skin. These features are noted almost exclusively within biopsy specimens from women, although similar alterations can occasionally be observed in melanocytic nevi from males. From the author's database (at the University of California, San Francisco), data clearly show that biopsies of genital melanocytic nevi are much more commonly performed in women than in men. These data do not unequivocally confirm that the prevalence of genital melanocytic nevi is truly increased in women, although this seems likely."
Melanoma,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-021-00815-z,A patient-centric dataset of images and metadata for identifying melanomas using clinical context,Abstract,"Prior skin image datasets have not addressed patient-level information obtained from multiple skin lesions from the same patient. Though artificial intelligence classification algorithms have achieved expert-level performance in controlled studies examining single images, in practice dermatologists base their judgment holistically from multiple lesions on the same patient. The 2020 SIIM-ISIC Melanoma Classification challenge dataset described herein was constructed to address this discrepancy between prior challenges and clinical practice, providing for each image in the dataset an identifier allowing lesions from the same patient to be mapped to one another. This patient-level contextual information is frequently used by clinicians to diagnose melanoma and is especially useful in ruling out false positives in patients with many atypical nevi. The dataset represents 2,056 patients (20.8% with at least one melanoma, 79.2% with zero melanomas) from three continents with an average of 16 lesions per patient, consisting of 33,126 dermoscopic images and 584 (1.8%) histopathologically confirmed melanomas compared with benign melanoma mimickers.

Melanocytic nevi,https://dermnetnz.org/topics/melanocytic-naevus,**Melanocytic naevus**,Who gets melanocytic naevi?,"Almost everyone has at least one melanocytic naevus. * About 1% of individuals are born with one or more congenital melanocytic naevi. This is usually sporadic, with rare instances of familial congenital naevi. * Fair-skinned people tend to have more melanocytic naevi than darker skinned people. * Melanocytic naevi that appear during childhood (aged 2 to 10 years) tend to be the most prominent and persistent throughout life. * Melanocytic naevi that are acquired later in childhood or adult life often follow sun exposure and may fade away or involute later. Most white-skinned New Zealanders have 20–50 melanocytic naevi."
Melanocytic nevi,https://dermnetnz.org/topics/melanocytic-naevus,**Melanocytic naevus**,What causes melanocytic naevi?,"Although the exact reason for the local proliferation of naevus cells is unknown, it is clear that the number of melanocytic naevi a person has depends on genetic factors, on sun exposure, and on immune status. * People with many melanocytic naevi tend to have family members that also have many similar lesions. * People living in Australia and New Zealand have many more naevi than their relatives residing in Northern Europe."
Melanocytic nevi,https://dermnetnz.org/topics/melanocytic-naevus,**Melanocytic naevus**,What are the clinical features of melanocytic naevi?,"Melanocytic naevi vary widely in clinical, dermatoscopic and histological appearance. * They may arise on any part of the body. * They differ in appearance depending on the body site. * They may be flat or protruding. * They vary in colour from pink or flesh tones to dark brown, steel blue, or black. * Light-skinned individuals tend to have light-coloured naevi and dark-skinned individuals tend to have dark brown or black naevi. * Although mostly round or oval in shape, moles are sometimes unusual shapes. * They range in size from a couple of millimetres to several centimetres in diameter."
Melanocytic nevi,https://dermnetnz.org/topics/melanocytic-naevus,**Melanocytic naevus**,Congenital melanocytic naevus,"Small congenital naevus | Medium congenital naevus | Giant naevus | Hairy congenital naevus ---|---|---|--- Small congenital naevus is 1.5 cm diameter. | Medium congenital naevi are 1.5–19.9 cm diameter. | A large or giant congenital melanocytic naevus is ≥ 20 cm | Hairy congenital naevi grow thick long hairs. Café au lait macule | Speckled lentiginous naevus | Naevus of Ota | Mongolian spot ---|---|---|--- The pathological classification of melanocytic naevi relates to where naevus cells are found in the skin. Junctional naevus | Dermal naevus | Compound naevus | Combined naevus ---|---|---|--- A junctional naevus has groups or nests of naevus cells at the junction of the epidermis and the dermis. A flat mole. | A dermal or intradermal naevus has naevus cell nests in the dermis. A papule, plaque or nodule with a pedunculated, papillomatous (Unna naevus) or smooth surface (Miescher naevus). | A compound naevus has nests of naevus cells at the epidermal-dermal junction as well as within the dermis. A central raised area surrounded by a flat patch. | A combined naevus has two distinct types of mole within the same lesion – usually blue naevus and compound naevus. Reticular naevus | Globular naevus | Blue naevus | Starburst naevus ---|---|---|--- Reticular naevus reveals a lattice of intersecting brown lines. | Globular naevus characteristically shows aggregated brown oval structures. | The blue naevus is a uniform structureless lesion, steel blue in colour. | Starburst naevus reveals radial lines around the periphery of the lesion.

Melanocytic nevi,https://dermnetnz.org/topics/melanocytic-naevus,**Melanocytic naevus**,Acquired melanocytic naevus,"Ordinary moles that appear after birth may be referred to as acquired naevi. Acquired melanocytic naevi are given a variety of names and there is considerable overlap of descriptions. Signature naevi are the predominant group of naevi in an individual with multiple moles. Solid brown naevus | Solid pink naevus | Eclipse naevus | Cockade naevus ---|---|---|--- Solid brown naevi have uniform brown pigmentation. | Solid pink naevi are seen in fair-skinned individuals and lack melanin pigmentation. | Eclipse naevus has a ring, or segment of a ring, of darker pigment around a tan or pink centre. Often found in the scalp. | Cockade, or naevus en cocarde/cockade, has a central dark naevus surrounded by concentric circles of light and dark pigmentation like a rosette. Naevus with perifollicular hypopigmentation | Fried-egg naevus | Lentiginous naevus | Naevus with eccentric pigmentation ---|---|---|--- Naevi with perifollicular hypopigmentation have white spots around each hair. Easier to see by dermoscopy. | Fried-egg naevus is a compound naevus with a flat rim of pigment around a bumpy central portion – the bump can be lighter or darker than the pigmented rim. | Lentiginous naevi are small, dark brown or black, flat lesions, often with a slightly paler rim – people with multiple lentiginous naevi have been said to have cheetah phenotype. | The Bolognia sign refers to a harmless, small area of darker colour on one side of the naevus. Uncommon types of melanocytic naevi include: * Reed naevus: darkly pigmented type of Spitz naevus with starburst dermatoscopic pattern * Agminated naevi: a cluster of similar moles * Kissing naevus: adjacent melanocytic naevi on upper and lower eyelids, due to naevus formation prior to separation of eyelids _in utero._ * A melanocytic naevus with specific characteristics: large (> 5 mm); ill-defined or irregular borders; varying shades of colour; with flat and bumpy components. * Or, any funny-looking naevus; large, or different from the patient’s other naevi. Atypical naevi usually occur in fair-skinned individuals and are due to sun exposure. They may be solitary or numerous. Pathology is reported as dysplastic junctional or compound naevus and has specific histological features (the Clark naevus). Common naevus | Naevus in dark skin | Atypical naevus | Dysplastic naevus ---|---|---|--- A common naevus is a flat mole with a single uniform colour. | In dark skin, naevi are often black in colour. | People with multiple atypical naevi are at increased risk of melanoma (cancerous mole). | Dysplastic naevus describes an atypical mole that has specific histological criteria. Blue naevus | Cellular naevus | Miescher naevus | Unna naevus ---|---|---|--- Meyerson naevus | Halo naevus | Spitz naevus | Reed naevus ---|---|---|--- Recurrent naevus | Agminated naevus | Acral naevus | Nail unit naevus ---|---|---|--- Recurrent naevus refers to the reappearance of pigment in a scar following surgical removal of a mole – this may have an odd shape. | An agminated naevus is a cluster of similar moles or freckles. | Acral naevus refers to one on the palm or sole. | Nail unit naevus causes a uniform longitudinal band of pigment on a nail."
Melanocytic nevi,https://dermnetnz.org/topics/melanocytic-naevus,**Melanocytic naevus**,What are the complications of melanocytic naevi?,"* At first, melanoma may look similar to a harmless melanocytic naevus, but in time it becomes more disordered in structure and tends to enlarge. * People with a greater number of naevi have a higher risk of developing melanoma than those with few naevi, especially if they have over 100 of them. Melanocytic naevi sometimes change for other reasons than melanoma, for example following sun exposure or during pregnancy. They can enlarge, regress or involute (disappear). * A recurrent naevus is one that appears in a scar following surgical removal of a melanocytic naevus — this may have an odd shape."
Melanocytic nevi,https://dermnetnz.org/topics/melanocytic-naevus,**Melanocytic naevus**,How is a melanocytic naevus diagnosed?,"Melanocytic naevi are usually diagnosed clinically by their typical appearance. If there is any doubt about the diagnosis, an expert may be consulted in person or with the help of clinical and dermatoscopic images. This is especially important if: * A naevus changes size, shape, structure or colour * A new naevus develops in adult life (> 40 years) * It appears different from the person’s other naevi (a so-called ugly duckling) * It has ABCD characteristics (Asymmetry, Border irregularity, Colour variation, Diameter > 6 mm) * It is bleeding, crusted or itchy."
Melanocytic nevi,https://dermnetnz.org/topics/melanocytic-naevus,**Melanocytic naevus**,What is the treatment for melanocytic naevus?,"Most melanocytic naevi are harmless and can be safely left alone. They may be removed in the following circumstances: * To exclude cancer * If a naevus is a nuisance: perhaps irritated by clothing, comb or razor * Cosmetic reasons: the mole is unsightly. Surgical techniques include:"
Melanocytic nevi,https://dermnetnz.org/topics/melanocytic-naevus,**Melanocytic naevus**,What is the outlook for melanocytic naevi?,Most melanocytic naevi that appear in childhood remain forever. Teenagers and young adults tend to have the greatest number of naevi. There are fewer in later life because some of them slowly fade away. * A patient noticing a significant change in a mole or a new lesion should show this to their doctor or dermatologist

Melanoma,https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8383488/,A Clinicopathological Analysis of Melanocytic Nevi: A Retrospective Series,Abstract,"**Purpose:** Melanocytic nevi are common cutaneous lesions. This study aimed to demonstrate the concordance and discordance between clinical and histopathological diagnoses of melanocytic nevi and the importance of histological evaluation in differentiating malignant lesions from diseases with similar clinical manifestations. **Patients and Methods:** We studied 4,561 consecutive patients with a clinical diagnosis of melanocytic nevi from 2014 to 2019. We compared the clinical diagnosis with the histopathological diagnosis to establish a histopathological concordance rate and then investigated the effects of clinical characteristics and the reasons for removal on misclassification. **Results:** Among 4,561 patients who were clinically diagnosed with melanocytic nevi, the overall histopathological concordance rate was 82.11% (3,745 of 4,561 patients), while the histopathological discordance rate was 17.89% (816 of 4,561 patients). The histopathological concordance included 90.25% common acquired melanocytic nevi (3,380 of 3,745 patients) and 9.75% other benign melanocytic neoplasms (365 of 3,745 patients). The most common diagnostic change was to seborrheic keratosis (_n_ = 470, 10.30%), followed by basal cell carcinoma (_n_ = 64, 1.40%), vascular tumor (_n_ = 53, 1.16%), fibroma (_n_ = 43, 0.94%), epidermoid cyst (_n_ = 34, 0.75%), wart (_n_ = 30, 0.66%), melanoma (_n_ = 24, 0.53%), Bowen's disease (_n_ = 16, 0.35%), squamous cell carcinoma (_n_ = 4, 0.09%), keratoacanthoma (_n_ = 2, 0.04%), and other neoplasms (_n_ = 76, 1.67%). Male sex, old age, location of the lesion, and the reasons for removal have a potential effect on misclassification. The percentages of misclassified lesions on the trunk and limbs and the perineum and buttocks were higher than those in lesions without a change in diagnosis. Importantly, locations of lesions on the head and neck were significantly related to a change in diagnosis to non-melanoma skin cancer, while locations on the hands and feet were significantly related to a change in diagnosis to melanoma. In addition to a typical clinical features, removal due to lesion changes or repeated stimulation was significantly associated with a change in diagnosis to melanoma. **Conclusions:** Our study emphasizes the clinical differential diagnosis of melanocytic nevi, especially the possibility of malignant tumors. The occurrence of clinical features associated with clinicopathological discordance should raise the clinical suspect and be carefully differentiated from malignant tumors. **Keywords:** melanocytic nevi, melanocytic diseases, melanoma, diagnosis, misclassification"

Melanoma,https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4609613/,Genetics of Melanocytic Nevi,Abstract,"Melanocytic nevi are a benign clonal proliferation of cells expressing the melanocytic phenotype, with heterogeneous clinical and molecular characteristics. In this review, we discuss the genetics of nevi by salient nevi subtypes: congenital melanocytic nevi, acquired melanocytic nevi, blue nevi, and Spitz nevi. While the molecular etiology of nevi has been less thoroughly studied than melanoma, it is clear that nevi and melanoma share common driver mutations. Acquired melanocytic nevi harbor oncogenic mutations in _BRAF_ , which is the predominant oncogene associated with melanoma. Congenital melanocytic nevi and blue nevi frequently harbor _NRAS_ mutations and _GNAQ_ mutations, respectively, while Spitz and atypical Spitz tumors often exhibit _HRAS_ and kinase rearrangements. These initial “driver” mutations are thought to trigger the establishment of benign nevi. After this initial phase of cell proliferation, a senescence program is executed, causing termination of nevi growth. Only upon the emergence of additional tumorigenic alterations, which may provide an escape from oncogene-induced senescence, can malignant progression occur. Here, we review the current literature on the pathobiology and genetics of nevi in the hope that additional studies of nevi promise to inform our understanding of the transition from benign neoplasm to malignancy. **Keywords:** congenital melanocytic nevi, acquired melanocytic nevi, Spitz nevi, blue nevi, genetics"

We tackle this problem by releasing the HAM10000 (“Human Against Machine with 10000 training images”) dataset. We collected dermatoscopic images from different populations acquired and stored by different modalities. Given this diversity we had to apply different acquisition and cleaning methods and developed semi-automatic workflows utilizing specifically trained neural networks. The final dataset consists of 10015 dermatoscopic images which are released as a training set for academic machine learning purposes and are publicly available through the ISIC archive. This benchmark dataset can be used for machine learning and for comparisons with human experts. Cases include a representative collection of all important diagnostic categories in the realm of pigmented lesions. More than 50% of lesions have been confirmed by pathology, while the ground truth for the rest of the cases was either follow-up, expert consensus, or confirmation by in-vivo confocal microscopy. **Subject terms:** Cancer screening, Squamous cell carcinoma, Melanoma, Basal cell carcinoma, Cancer imaging"

We extracted cases from this system by filtering SQL-tables with a proprietary tool provided by the manufacturer. We selected only non-melanocytic lesions with a consensus benign diagnosis, nevi with >1.5 years of digital dermatoscopic follow-up, and excised lesions with a histopathologic report. Histopathologic reports were matched manually to specific lesions. From a series of multiple sequential images of the same nevus we extracted only the most recent one. Some melanomas of this set were also photographed with a DermLiteTM FOTO (3GenTM) camera. These additional images became also part of the ViDIR image series, where different images of the same lesion were labeled with a common identifier string. Original images of the MoleMax HD system had a resolution of 1872x1053px (MoleMax HD) with non-quadratic pixels. We manually cropped all MoleMax HD images to 800x600px (72DPI), centered the lesion if necessary, and reverted the format to quadratic pixels."

Cases with uncertain diagnoses and collisions were excluded except for melanomas in association with a nevus. We unified the diagnoses and formed seven generic classes, and specifically avoided ambiguous classifications. The histopathologic expression ""superficial spreading melanoma in situ, arising in a preexisting dermal nevus"", for example, should only be allocated to the ""melanoma"" class and not to the nevus class. The seven generic classes were chosen for simplicity and in regard of the intended use as a benchmark dataset for the diagnosis of pigmented lesions by humans and machines. The seven classes covered more than 95% of all pigmented lesions examined in daily clinical practice of the two study sites. A more detailed description of the disease classes is given in the usage notes below."

Only nevi, but no other benign diagnoses were labeled with this type of ground-truth because dermatologists usually do not monitor dermatofibromas, seborrheic keratoses, or vascular lesions. The presence of change was assessed by author HK who has more than 20 years of experience in digital dermatoscopic follow-up."
Melanoma,https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6091241/,"The HAM10000 dataset, a large collection of multi-source dermatoscopic images of common pigmented skin lesions",Consensus,For typical benign cases without histopathology or follow-up we provide an expert-consensus rating of authors PT and HK. We applied the consensus label only if both authors independently gave the same unequivocal benign diagnosis. Lesions with this type of ground-truth were usually photographed for educational reasons and did not need further follow-up or biopsy for confirmation.
Melanoma,https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6091241/,"The HAM10000 dataset, a large collection of multi-source dermatoscopic images of common pigmented skin lesions",Usage Notes,"The HAM10000 training set includes pigmented lesions from different populations. The Austrian image set consists of lesions of patients referred to a tertiary European referral center specialized for early detection of melanoma in high risk groups. This group of patients often have a high number of nevi and a personal or family history of melanoma. The Australian image set includes lesions from patients of a primary care facility in a high skin cancer incidence area. Australian patients are typified by severe chronic sun damage. Chronic sun damaged skin is characterized by multiple solar lentigines and ectatic vessels, which are often present in the periphery of the target lesion. Very rarely also small angiomas and seborrheic keratoses may collide with the target lesion. We did not remove this ""noise"" and we also did not remove terminal hairs because it reflects the situation in clinical practice. In most cases, albeit not always, the target lesion is in the center of the image. Dermatoscopic images of both study sites were taken by different devices using polarized and non-polarized dermatoscopy. The set includes representative examples of pigmented skin lesions that are practically relevant. More than 95% of all lesion encountered during clinical practice will fall into one of the seven diagnostic categories. In practice, the task of the clinician is to differentiate between malignant and benign lesions, but also to make specific diagnoses because different malignant lesions, for example melanoma and basal cell carcinoma, may be treated in a different way and timeframe. With the exception of vascular lesions, which are pigmented by hemoglobin and not by melanin, all lesions have variants that are completely devoid of pigment (for example amelanotic melanoma). Non-pigmented lesions, which are more diverse and have a larger number of possible differential diagnoses, are not part of this set. The following description of diagnostic categories is meant for computer scientists who are not familiar with the dermatology literature:"
Melanoma,https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6091241/,"The HAM10000 dataset, a large collection of multi-source dermatoscopic images of common pigmented skin lesions",mel,"Melanoma is a malignant neoplasm derived from melanocytes that may appear in different variants. If excised in an early stage it can be cured by simple surgical excision. Melanomas can be invasive or non-invasive (in situ). We included all variants of melanoma including melanoma in situ, but did exclude non-pigmented, subungual, ocular or mucosal melanoma."
Melanoma,https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6091241/,"The HAM10000 dataset, a large collection of multi-source dermatoscopic images of common pigmented skin lesions",vasc,"Angiomas are dermatoscopically characterized by red or purple color and solid, well circumscribed structures known as red clods or lacunes."

Example triplet of the same lesion.,"Rather than cropped to different sizes of a large source image, these were originally taken at different magnifications and angles. Images in the dataset may diverge from those an end-user, especially lay persons, would provide in a real-world scenario. For example, insufficiently magnified images of small lesions or out of focus images were removed. We used automated screening by neural networks, multiple manual reviews and cleared EXIF-data of the images to remove any potentially identifiable information. Data can thus be regarded anonymized to the best of our knowledge and the data collection was approved by the ethics review committee at the Medical University of Vienna and the University of Queensland."

Changes in the rates of new melanomas vary by age and sex. In people younger than 50, the rates have been stable among women and have declined by about 1% a year in men since the early 2000s. In people ages 50 and older, rates increased in women by about 3% per year but have stayed stable among men.

Melanoma,https://melanoma.org/facts-stats/,Melanoma Facts & Stats,Melanoma Diagnosis Facts,"* Melanoma is the deadliest form of skin cancer. Skin cancer is the most common form of cancer in the U.S. * In 2023, melanoma is expected to take the lives of 7,990 Americans.**1** * Melanoma is not just skin cancer. It can develop anywhere on the body – eyes, scalp, nails, feet, mouth, etc. * Melanoma does not discriminate by age, race or gender. * In ages 30-39, melanoma is the fifth most commonly diagnosed form of cancer. * The incidence of people under 30 developing melanoma is increasing faster than any other demographic group, soaring by 50% in women since 1980. * Melanoma rates in the United States doubled from 1982 to 2011 and have continued to increase.**5** * Today, approximately 1.3 million people live with melanoma in the U.S.**4** * The lifetime risk of getting melanoma is about 1 in 40 for Caucasians, 1 in 200 for Hispanics and 1 in 1,000 for African Americans. * People of color are more likely to get melanoma in areas that don’t see the sun – like the palms of the hands, the soles of the feet, under the nails.**6** * Skin cancer in people of color is often diagnosed in later stages, making it more difficult to treat.**6**"
Melanoma,https://melanoma.org/facts-stats/,Melanoma Facts & Stats,Melanoma Prevention Facts,* Nearly 90% of melanomas are thought to be caused by exposure to UV light and sunlight.**9** * Experiencing five or more blistering sunburns between ages 15 and 20 increases one’s melanoma risk by 80 percent.**10**

Melanoma,https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8544364/,Epidemiology of Melanoma,Abstract,"Melanoma accounts for 1.7% of global cancer diagnoses and is the fifth most common cancer in the US. Melanoma incidence is rising in developed, predominantly fair-skinned countries, growing over 320% in the US since 1975. However, US mortality has fallen almost 30% over the past decade with the approval of 10 new targeted or immunotherapy agents since 2011. Mutations in the signaling-protein BRAF, present in half of cases, are targeted with oral BRAF/MEK inhibitor combinations, while checkpoint inhibitors are used to restore immunosurveillance likely inactivated by UV radiation. Although the overall 5-year survival has risen to 93.3% in the US, survival for stage IV disease remains only 29.8%. Melanoma is most common in white, older men, with an average age of diagnosis of 65. Outdoor UV exposure without protection is the main risk factor, although indoor tanning beds, immunosuppression, family history and rare congenital diseases, moles, and obesity contribute to the disease. Primary prevention initiatives in Australia implemented since 1988, such as education on sun-protection, have increased sun-screen usage and curbed melanoma incidence, which peaked in Australia in 2005. In the US, melanoma incidence is not projected to peak until 2022–2026. Fewer than 40% of Americans report practicing adequate protection (sun avoidance from 10 a.m.–4 p.m. and regular application of broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF > 30). A 2-4-fold return on investment is predicted for a US sun-protection education initiative. Lesion-directed skin screening programs, especially for those at risk, have also cost-efficiently reduced melanoma mortality. **Keywords:** melanoma, epidemiology, incidence, mortality, prevention, risk factors"
Melanoma,https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8544364/,Epidemiology of Melanoma,3.1. Sun Exposure,"UV exposure is the primary risk factor for melanoma of the skin, though this effect is heavily modulated by genetics, melanin, and UV wavelengths."
Melanoma,https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8544364/,Epidemiology of Melanoma,4. Prevention,"Public health initiatives in some developed nations, such as Australia, have been effective in curbing the growth in melanoma incidence and should be used as models for education and funding in the US."
Melanoma,https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8544364/,Epidemiology of Melanoma,5. Conclusions,"Melanoma is a leading cancer diagnosis in the developed world and is projected to continue to increase in incidence over the coming decades. Mortality rates have fallen thanks to advances in targeted and immunotherapies, though those diagnosed with stage IV disease still have a dismal survival rate. Prevention remains essential for reducing healthcare costs and minimizing morbidity and mortality. Risk factors such as UV exposure without broad-spectrum sunscreen or other protection, indoor tanning, immunosuppression, and obesity are primary targets for educational programs, which have been highly effective in decreasing melanoma incidence in Australia. Screening is recommended for those with risk factors such as family or prior history, congenital diseases, predisposing lifestyle/occupation, and high-risk demographics, in particular older, white men."

Melanoma,http://biomedia.vn/review/ung-thu-hac-to-melanoma-phan-2.html,,Ung thư hắc tố- Melanoma (Phần 2),"BioMedia **Các dạng** Ung thư hắc tố có 4 dạng cơ bản bao gồm 3 dạng bắt đầu tại chỗ (in situ) - có nghĩa là khối u chỉ nằm ở các lớp trên cùng của da - và đôi khi xâm lấn; dạng thứ tư ngay từ khi hình thành đã bắt đầu xâm lấn. Khối u hắc tố xâm lấn nguy hiểm hơn, một khi chúng đã thâm nhập sâu hơn vào da, chúng có thể lan ra các khu vực khác của cơ thể. Dạng phổ biến nhất là ung thư hắc tố lan trên bề mặt (**Superficial spreading melanoma**), chiếm 70% ca bệnh và thường gặp ở những người trẻ tuổi. Trong một khoảng thời gian khá dài, khối u phát triển tại các lớp da trên cùng trước khi thâm nhập sâu hơn. Dấu hiệu đầu tiên là sự xuất hiện của một mảng da phẳng hoặc hơi lồi có màu thay đổi và có viền bất bình thường. Đây là loại u ác tính có thể hình thành từ một nốt ruồi lành tính. Ung thư hắc tố lentigo (**Lentigo maligna**) tương tự như dạng 1 vì nó cũng xuất hiệngần với bề mặt da trong một khoảng thời gian. Đây là dạng ung thư hắc tố tại chỗ thường thấy nhất ở người già, phát sinh sau thời gian dài tiếp xúc với ánh nắng, da bị hư hỏng trên mặt, tai, tay và thân trên. Dạng 3 **Acral lentiginousmelanoma** cũng xuất hiện trên bề mặt trước khi thâm nhập sâu hơn. Dấu hiệu gồm có sự đổi màu đen hoặc nâu dưới móng tay hoặc lòng bàn tay, bàn chân. Bệnh thường tiến nhanh hơn so với hai dạng bệnh đầu. Đây là loại khối u hắc tố thường gặp nhất ở người Mỹ gốc Phi và người châu Á, đôi khi được tìm thấy ở người da đen và ít gặp ở người da trắng. Dạng 4 Ung thư hắc tố dạng nốt **(Nodular melanoma****)** thường đã di căn tại thời điểm chẩn đoán. Các khối u có dạng vết sưng màu đen, màu xanh, xám, trắng, nâu, nâu, đỏ hoặc màu da. U xuất hiện ở thân, chân và cánh tay, chủ yếu là ở người cao tuổi và nó cũng có thể có da đầu ở nam giới. Đây là dạng phức tạp nhất và được tìm thấy trong 10 đến 15% các trường hợp."
Melanoma,http://biomedia.vn/review/ung-thu-hac-to-melanoma-phan-2.html,,Các giai đoạn tiến triển bệnh,"Ung thư hắc tố giai đoạn đầu (giai đoạn 0 và I) khu trú tại phạm vi nhất định; giai đoạn 0, khối u không xâm lấn và không xâm nhập vào bên dưới bề mặt da, trong khi các khối u ở giai đoạn I đã xâm chiếm một phần da nhỏ và phân bào chậm để phát triển. Giai đoạn II khối u lớn hơn và/ hoặc có thể bị loét; đây được coi là giai đoạn trung gian. Ung thư hắc tố giai đoạn cuối (giai đoạn III và IV) di căn tới các bộ phận khác của cơ thể."
Melanoma,http://biomedia.vn/review/ung-thu-hac-to-melanoma-phan-2.html,,Hệ thống xác định giai đoạn ung thư hắc tố,"Năm 2010, hệ thống phân loại mới theo khuyến cáo của Ủy ban Hỗn hợp Hoa Kỳ về ung thư (AJCC) đã được cập nhật. Trước đây, người ta dùng thang Clark (mức độ xâm lấn, số lượng các lớp tế bào da bị tổn thương bởi khối u). Tuy nhiên với hệ thống mới này, thang Clark không còn quá quan trọng trong chẩn đoán. Các yếu tố quan trọng nhất trong hệ thống mới là độ dày của khối u, được gọi là độ dày Breslow (hay chiều sâu Breslow), sự xuất hiện của các vết loét và tốc độ phân bào. Chỉ sử dụng thang Clark trong những trường hợp hiếm khi không xác định được tốc độ phân bào."
Melanoma,http://biomedia.vn/review/ung-thu-hac-to-melanoma-phan-2.html,,Ung thư hắc tố giai đoạn đầu (Giai đoạn lâm sàng I và II),"• Giai đoạn Tis. Các khối u tại chỗ và không xâm lấn trong lớp biểu bì. • Giai đoạn T1a. Các khối u xâm lấn nhưng có độ dày Breslow = 1/mm2. • Giai đoạn T2a. Các khối u dày 1.01-2,0 mm và không loét • Giai đoạn T2b. Các khối u dày 1,01-2,0 mm và loét. • Giai đoạn T3a. Các khối u ác tính dày 2,01-4,0 mm và không loét. • Giai đoạn T3b. Các khối u ác tính là dày 2,01-4,0 mm và loét. • Giai đoạn 4a. Khối u dày hơn 4,0 mm và không loét • Giai đoạn T4b. Khối u là dày hơn 4,0 mm và loét."
Melanoma,http://biomedia.vn/review/ung-thu-hac-to-melanoma-phan-2.html,,Ung thư hắc tố các giai đoạn cuối,"Giai đoạn III. Tại thời gian một khối u hắc tố tiến triển tới giai đoạn III, việc xác định giai đoạn bệnh không còn dựa vào độ dày Breslow nhưng vẫn sử dụng tình trạng viêm loét để đánh giá. Tại thời điểm này, các khối u đã lan rộng cả đến các hạch bạch huyết hoặc phần da giữa các khối u nguyên phát và các hạch bạch huyết gần đó. Giai đoạn IV. Các khối u hắc tố di căn đến các hạch bạch huyết nằm xa khối u nguyên phát hoặc di căn tới các cơ quan nội tạng, thường là phổi, và sau đó là gan, não, xương, và hệ tiêu hóa. Hai nhân tố chính trong việc xác định mức độ nghiêm trọng củabệnh vào giai đoạn IV là phạm vi di căn và hàm lượng enzyme lactate dehydrogenase huyết thanh (LDH)."
Melanoma,http://biomedia.vn/review/ung-thu-hac-to-melanoma-phan-2.html,,Phẫu thuật,"Bước đầu tiên trong quá trình điều trị là loại bỏ các khối u hắc tố, và phương pháp tiêu chuẩn để thực hiện điều này là phẫu thuật cắt bỏ. Trong thập kỷ qua, công tác phẫu thuật đã có những bước tiến lớn, bệnh nhân phải trải qua ít lần phẫu thuật hơn và dễ dàng phục hồi hơn."
Melanoma,http://biomedia.vn/review/ung-thu-hac-to-melanoma-phan-2.html,,Phẫu thuật nội/ ngoại trú,"Trong hầu hết các trường hợp, phẫu thuật khối u hắc tố mới có thể được thực hiện tại phòng mổ của bác sĩ hoặc như là một quy trình ngoại trú gây tê tại chỗ. Chỉ khâu vẫn được giữ nguyên trong 1-2 tuần, và hầu hết các bệnh nhân được khuyên nên tránh những bài tập nặng trong thời gian này. Phẫu thuật để lại sẹo nhỏ và cải thiện theo thời gian bằng cách sử dụng mỹ phẩm phù hợp. Phẫu thuật cắt bỏ (**Surgical excision**) sử dụng điều trị tất cả các dạng ung thư da. Đây là phương pháp cho hiệu quả y học cũng như thẩm mỹ. Các bác sĩ bắt đầu bằng việc khoanh vùng các khối u với một cây bút đánh dấu và sau đótiến hành gây tê cục bộ và cắt dọc theo đường đã vẽ. Toàn bộ quy trình mất khoảng ba mươi phút cho các tổn thương nhỏ hơn. Vết thương lành nhanh chóng, thường là trong một hoặc hai tuần. Sẹo hình thành phụ thuộc vào nhiều yếu tố, bao gồm vị trí của khối u và quá trình chăm sóc bệnh nhân sau phẫu thuật. Các mẫu mô này sẽ được gửi đến một phòng thí nghiệm, để kiểm tra liệu ""ngưỡng an toàn"" có bị xâm chiếm bởi khối u. Nếu trường hợp này xảy ra, rất có thể khối u vẫn còn hiện diện, và cần phẫu thuật bổ sung. Đôi khi, phẫu thuật Mohs micrographic là một lựa chọn tốt vào thời điểm này."
Melanoma,http://biomedia.vn/review/ung-thu-hac-to-melanoma-phan-2.html,,Phẫu thuật Mohs Micrographic,"Trong những năm gần đây, phẫu thuật Mohs Micrographic được xem là kỹ thuật hiệu quả nhất để loại bỏ ung thư tế bào đáy và ung thư tế bào biểu mô vảy (hai loại ung thư da phổ biến nhất). Trong kỹ thuật này, một lớp mô mỏng được lấy ra tại một thời điểm, và khi mỗi lớp được lấy ra, “ngưỡng an toàn” của nó được quan sát dưới kính hiển vi, nếu không còn tế bào ung thư, phẫu thuật kết thúc. Phẫu thuật tiếp tục nếu tế bào ung thư còn tồn tại, bác sĩ sẽ cắt bỏ thêm nhiều mô, và quy trình này được lặp đi lặp lại cho đến khi “ngưỡng an toàn” không còn tế bào ung thư. Phẫu thuật Mohs khác với các kỹ thuật khác vì sự kiểm tra bằng kính hiển vi đối với tất cả các mô đã cắt bỏ trong phẫu thuật cho phép không cần thiết phải ""ước tính"" mức độ lan rộng của khối u. Điều này giúp loại bỏ tất cả các tế bào ung thư mà vẫn duy trì mô lành ở mức tối đa."

Like other convolutions, it is based around a kernel, which represents the shape and size of the neighborhood to be sampled when calculating the mean. The mean filter is usually used to suppress the small details in an image and also bridge the small gaps that exist in the lines or curves. The mean filter is defined in equation 9. g(i,j)=1MxN∑f(m,n)(9)g(i,j)=1M x N∑f(m,n)(9) where m = 1, 2… M and n = 1, 2… N and S is the neighborhood defined by the filter mask of the point f (i, j), centered at point f (i, j)."

In this context, two supportive approaches, namely, histogram equalization (HE) and piecewise linear transformation (PLT), have been applied to all the images of the dataset to make a set of 3,297 images for each filter after applying an image enhancement technique. As we considered five image filters, we were supposed to get 5 * 3,297 images for a particular enhancement technique; however, we selected the PSNR, MAE, and SSIM values of a filter. The image selection process is completed after implementing both of these enhancement techniques. The explanations to these two techniques are described as follows."

Melanoma,https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10188172/,Benign Keratosis: A Useful Term?,Introduction,"Seborrheic keratosis (SK), lichen planus-like keratosis (LPLK), and solar lentigo (SL) are common benign skin lesions. These lesions are frequently seen adjacent to each other or can arise from one another. They can sometimes be difficult to differentiate despite having distinct histopathological features."
Melanoma,https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10188172/,Benign Keratosis: A Useful Term?,Objectives,We evaluated dermoscopic images of 80 skin lesions to confirm the term ‘benign keratosis’ is useful for an undifferentiated SK/LPLK/SL where there are overlapping clinical and dermoscopic characteristics.
Melanoma,https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10188172/,Benign Keratosis: A Useful Term?,Methods,"Clinical and dermoscopic images were sourced from a teledermoscopy service database of 13,000 lesions in 7,000 patients. The database was queried for SK, SL or LPLK in sun-exposed sites. Each lesion was evaluated based on specific dermoscopic criteria and the results analyzed."
Melanoma,https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10188172/,Benign Keratosis: A Useful Term?,Results,"Lesions were identified with mixed clinical and dermoscopic criteria of SK and SL, and in some, dermoscopic criteria for LPLK were also present."
Melanoma,https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10188172/,Benign Keratosis: A Useful Term?,Conclusions,"This study highlights the relationship between these lesions. We confirm the term ‘benign keratosis’ is useful for mixed lesions or for those that are difficult to classify. **Keywords:** benign keratosis, seborrhoeic keratosis, lichen planus-like keratosis, solar lentigo, dermoscopy"
Melanoma,https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10188172/,Benign Keratosis: A Useful Term?,Introduction,"However, the term ‘benign keratosis’ is not well known by dermatologists. The classification of these entities by clinical terminology tools is inconsistent. * ICD-11 (version 09/2020) lists all three entities within the benign squamous cell neoplasm category (seborrheic keratosis XH0949, solar lentigo XHB58, lichen planus-like keratosis XH63L8), and includes a separate entry for benign keratosis, NOS (XH0S03)."

Benign keratosis-like lesions,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-55617-1,Comparative study on the age-related incidence of seborrheic keratosis and verruca plana in patients with verruca plana-like lesions,Abstract,"Seborrheic keratosis (SK) is a common skin disease in the elderly. However, in cases where SK presenting as multiple skin-colored or clustered lesions can be easily misdiagnosed as verruca plana (VP), especially in the young population. This retrospective study investigated the prevalence of SK and VP in the lesions that appear clinically similar to VP according to age. We examined the pathology slides of the skin tissue and photographs of patients who were clinically suspected to have VP. A total of 503 patients were included in the study, out of which 174 patients were finally diagnosed with SK (34.6%) and 132 with VP (26.2%). The mean ages of the SK- and VP-diagnosed group were 39.3 and 35.4 years, respectively. SK had a higher prevalence among individuals older than 30 years, and relative frequency of SK should not be ignored in patients with a grouped distribution in their 20 s and 30 s. Therefore, our study suggests that multiple verrucous skin-colored to brownish plaques are also commonly diagnosed as SK in young people as well as VP, and the prevalence of SK and VP may not always depend solely on chronological aging, and the prevalence of SK among young people may be higher than commonly believed stereotypes suggest."

If the patient is female, or if the lesion is on the face, less than 3 mm in size, has a brownish color, and is distributed in a scattered pattern, the likelihood of diagnosis of SK increases. Among patients with SK and VP, the average ages at the time of diagnosis were 39.3 and 35.4 years, respectively. In addition, the 30–39 age group showed a higher proportion of SK-diagnosed cases than VP-diagnosed cases. Both SK-diagnosed- and VP-diagnosed cases showed a similar prevalence in the 20–29 age group. These findings suggested that clinically presented VP-like lesions were mostly SK, and the prevalence proportion of SK should not be ignored in patients in their 1920s and 1930s. \(2000\).""). They suggested that SK is also common in young people, and that the term senile keratosis, another term for SK, was no longer appropriate. \(2020\).""). Furthermore, although VP usually requires treatment because of high risk of transmission to others, SK does not cause medical problems other than cosmetic concerns. Therefore, differentiation between these two diseases is required to relieve the patients from unnecessary distress and for medical counseling. \(2021\).""). Thus, unexpected development of SK in young patients may be caused by accelerated cellular senescence, rather than their chronological age. Further studies are needed to identify the association with pathogenesis of SK and cellular senescence. Our study had several limitations. The study population did not include all VP-like lesions. Also, there may is a potential risk of selection bias, as the included patients were those who underwent biopsies, possibly indicating the presence of atypical VP-like lesions. However, since we included all cases in which biopsy was performed with the clinical impression of both SK and VP, we believe that our results are still meaningful because this study enrolled all cases in which biopsy was necessary to confirm the diagnosis of VP-like lesions, owing to the difficulty in differentiating between the two diseases. In addition, the study was conducted through a retrospective review of clinical photographs and electronic medical records and included patients from a single tertiary center. Finally, due to the limitations of the retrospective study design, we were unable to investigate the patients' Fitzpatrick skin type. This limitation prevented us from accurately reflecting the patients' UV exposure or skin color. In the present study, we observed that lesions clinically diagnosed as VP in young adults were also commonly diagnosed as SK. Despite the common conception that SK is diagnosed mostly in the elderly, we suggest that SK can occur in individuals of all age groups. As patients could suffer from unnecessary anxiety assuming the spread of the virus, we think our observations will be helpful in reassuring young patients with lesions that may be confused with VP, such as multiple, grouped, or skin-colored lesions."

We tackle this problem by releasing the HAM10000 (“Human Against Machine with 10000 training images”) dataset. We collected dermatoscopic images from different populations acquired and stored by different modalities. Given this diversity we had to apply different acquisition and cleaning methods and developed semi-automatic workflows utilizing specifically trained neural networks. The final dataset consists of 10015 dermatoscopic images which are released as a training set for academic machine learning purposes and are publicly available through the ISIC archive. This benchmark dataset can be used for machine learning and for comparisons with human experts. Cases include a representative collection of all important diagnostic categories in the realm of pigmented lesions. More than 50% of lesions have been confirmed by pathology, while the ground truth for the rest of the cases was either follow-up, expert consensus, or confirmation by in-vivo confocal microscopy.

We extracted cases from this system by filtering SQL-tables with a proprietary tool provided by the manufacturer. We selected only non-melanocytic lesions with a consensus benign diagnosis, nevi with >1.5 years of digital dermatoscopic follow-up, and excised lesions with a histopathologic report. Histopathologic reports were matched manually to specific lesions. From a series of multiple sequential images of the same nevus we extracted only the most recent one. Some melanomas of this set were also photographed with a DermLiteTM FOTO (3GenTM) camera. These additional images became also part of the ViDIR image series, where different images of the same lesion were labeled with a common identifier string. Original images of the MoleMax HD system had a resolution of 1872x1053px (MoleMax HD) with non-quadratic pixels. We manually cropped all MoleMax HD images to 800x600px (72DPI), centered the lesion if necessary, and reverted the format to quadratic pixels."

Cases with uncertain diagnoses and collisions were excluded except for melanomas in association with a nevus. We unified the diagnoses and formed seven generic classes, and specifically avoided ambiguous classifications. The histopathologic expression ""superficial spreading melanoma in situ, arising in a preexisting dermal nevus"", for example, should only be allocated to the ""melanoma"" class and not to the nevus class. The seven generic classes were chosen for simplicity and in regard of the intended use as a benchmark dataset for the diagnosis of pigmented lesions by humans and machines. The seven classes covered more than 95% of all pigmented lesions examined in daily clinical practice of the two study sites. A more detailed description of the disease classes is given in the usage notes below."

Melanoma,https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata2018161,"The HAM10000 dataset, a large collection of multi-source dermatoscopic images of common pigmented skin lesions",Usage Notes,"The HAM10000 training set includes pigmented lesions from different populations. The Austrian image set consists of lesions of patients referred to a tertiary European referral center specialized for early detection of melanoma in high risk groups. This group of patients often have a high number of nevi and a personal or family history of melanoma. The Australian image set includes lesions from patients of a primary care facility in a high skin cancer incidence area. Australian patients are typified by severe chronic sun damage. Chronic sun damaged skin is characterized by multiple solar lentigines and ectatic vessels, which are often present in the periphery of the target lesion. Very rarely also small angiomas and seborrheic keratoses may collide with the target lesion. We did not remove this ""noise"" and we also did not remove terminal hairs because it reflects the situation in clinical practice. In most cases, albeit not always, the target lesion is in the center of the image. Dermatoscopic images of both study sites were taken by different devices using polarized and non-polarized dermatoscopy. The set includes representative examples of pigmented skin lesions that are practically relevant. More than 95% of all lesion encountered during clinical practice will fall into one of the seven diagnostic categories. In practice, the task of the clinician is to differentiate between malignant and benign lesions, but also to make specific diagnoses because different malignant lesions, for example melanoma and basal cell carcinoma, may be treated in a different way and timeframe. With the exception of vascular lesions, which are pigmented by hemoglobin and not by melanin, all lesions have variants that are completely devoid of pigment (for example amelanotic melanoma). Non-pigmented lesions, which are more diverse and have a larger number of possible differential diagnoses, are not part of this set.

Benign keratosis-like lesions,https://bestpractice.bmj.com/topics/en-us/617,Seborrheic keratosis,Summary,"Seborrheic keratoses are common, multiple, benign tumors of the skin. They usually appear in the fourth and fifth decades of life and their prevalence increases with age and sun exposure. They appear as well-circumscribed ""stuck-on"" plaques or papules and may look like warts. They are usually asymptomatic but can become irritated and inflamed spontaneously or because of friction from clothing. Treatment is not necessary because of their benign nature, but if irritated, itching, and displeasing, can be initially treated with cryotherapy and curettage. Most important differential diagnosis, and of patient concern, is malignant melanoma."

Benign keratosis-like lesions,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482439/,"[Bookshelf](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/ ""Bookshelf home"")",Etiology,"Cumulative UV dose and skin type are not sole predictors; exposure duration and intensity, particularly in early childhood and adolescence, also plays a role in BCC development. Recreational sunlight exposure and the use of indoor tanning salons are a contributing factor for the development of BCCs. UV light therapy may also lead to BCC occurrence. Intermittent intense sun exposure, as identified by prior sunburns; a positive family history of BCC; a fair complexion, especially red hair; easy sunburning (skin types I or II); and blistering sunburns in childhood are also risk factors for the development of BCC. Ultraviolet light exposure is not the only risk factor as 20% of BCC arise on non–sun-exposed skin. BCCs also occur due to various other factors such as ionizing radiation exposure, arsenic exposure, immunosuppression, and genetic predisposition. Some genetic syndromes associated with an increased risk of BCCs are xeroderma pigmentosum, basal cell nevus syndrome (also known as Gorlin syndrome), Bazex–Dupre–Christol syndrome, and Rombo syndrome. There is no association with diet, but smoking also appears to be a risk factor in females."
Benign keratosis-like lesions,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482439/,"[Bookshelf](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/ ""Bookshelf home"")",Epidemiology,"Over the last 30 years, estimated incidence rates have risen between 20% and 80%. Incidence rates for BCC also increase with age, with the median age of diagnosis being 68 years. Mortality from BCC is uncommon and occurs primarily in immunocompromised patients. Metastatic BCC (1%) is more likely the result of tumors with aggressive histopathologic patterns (morpheaform, metatypical, basosquamous, infiltrating). If a BCC does metastasize, it often involves regional lymph nodes, bone, lungs, and skin. The mean age at the time of death is higher than with SCC, and the estimate for age-adjusted mortality rate is 0.12 per 100 000. The mortality risk is related to increasing age, male gender (greater than twice the rate of occurrence compared with women), and White race phenotype."
Benign keratosis-like lesions,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482439/,"[Bookshelf](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/ ""Bookshelf home"")",Pathophysiology,"The mechanism of BCC formation via ultraviolet radiation is direct DNA damage, indirect DNA damage through reactive oxygen species, and immune suppression. Melanin absorbs UVA and indirectly damages DNA through free radicals. UVB directly damages DNA and RNA with a characteristic C/T or CC/TT transition. Ultraviolet exposure also causes dose-dependent suppression of the cutaneous immune system, impairing immune surveillance of skin cancer. Literature suggests that the cells of origin from which BCC arises are immature, pluripotent cells associated with the hair follicle. Of note, the gene most often altered in BCCs is the _PTCH1_ gene. _PTCH1_ gene mutations occur in 70% of people with sporadic BCC. Ten percent to 20% of people with sporadic BCC have smoothened (_SMO)_ mutations. Literature suggests that a sufficiently elevated expression level of _Gli_ , by activating mutations of _SMO or_ by homozygous inactivation of _PTCH1_ in a responding cell, is sufficient to drive the formation of BCC. The second most common mutation found in BCCs is in the _P53_ gene. Mutations in _CDKN2A_ locus also have been detected in a smaller number of sporadic BCCs."
Benign keratosis-like lesions,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482439/,"[Bookshelf](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/ ""Bookshelf home"")",Histopathology,"The characteristic feature seen in BCCs is islands or nests of basaloid cells, with cells palisading at the periphery in a haphazard arrangement in the centers of the islands. Each of these small pleomorphic cells is composed of a basophilic nucleus without a discernible nucleolus and scanty cytoplasm. Retraction artifact, also referred to as clefting, is usually is seen between the tumor and its surrounding stroma on paraffin-embedded sections. Mucin deposition may be present within the tumor and in the stroma around the tumor. Mitotic figures also may be present. Perineural growth, also known to as perineural invasion, can be an indicator of aggressive disease. The histologic differential diagnosis may include trichoepithelioma or trichoblastoma. Various morphological subtypes have been defined, including nodular (solid), micronodular, superficial, cystic, infiltrating, infundibulocystic, pigmented, adenoid, sclerosing, metatypical, basosquamous, and fibroepitheliomatous (see **Image.** Pigmented Basal Cell Carcinoma). Mixed patterns of the above-listed types are also common. * The pigmented BCC results from the presence of melanocytes and melanin admixed with the tumor cells, which is more common in the superficial, micronodular, or follicular variants. * The infundibulocystic variant is uncommon and often found on the face. This variant is a small, well-circumscribed tumor composed of nests of cells arranged in an anastomosing manner with little stroma. Numerous small infundibular cyst-like structures contain keratinous material and sometimes melanin. * Basosquamous or metatypical BCC shows features of both BCC and SCC. The exact nature of this lesion is controversial, but most reserve this term for the rare basal cell carcinoma composed of nests and strands of cells maturing into larger and paler cells without peripheral palisading."
Benign keratosis-like lesions,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482439/,"[Bookshelf](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/ ""Bookshelf home"")",History and Physical,"Many clinical variants of BCC exist, but the most recognized types are superficial, nodular, and morphea-like BCC. Nodular BCC is the most common (see **Image.** Nodulocystic Basal Cell Carcinoma). BCC typically presents as a shiny, pink- or flesh-colored papule or nodule with surface telangiectasia. The tumor may enlarge and ulcerate, giving the borders a rolled or rodent ulcer appearance. The most common sites for nodular basal cells are the face, especially the nose, cheeks, forehead, nasolabial folds, and eyelids. Patients often give a history of crusting and recurrent bleeding, causing them to seek evaluation. Pigmented nodular BCCs are more common in dark-skinned individuals. Superficial BCCs present as a pink-red, scaly, macule or patch, which may contain telangiectasia (see **Image.** Superficial Basal Cell Carcinoma). They have a predilection for the shoulders, chest, or back, and multiple lesions may be present. There are also pigmented variants of superficial BCC. Clinically, superficial BCC can appear similar to inflammatory dermatoses such as eczema or psoriasis, so one should consider the diagnosis of superficial BCC when faced with a persistent, erythematous, scaly plaque. Portions of superficial basal cell carcinomas can evolve into nodular BCC over time. The other common clinical variant of BCC is the morpheaform subtype. This tumor frequently presents as white- or flesh-colored with areas of induration and ill-defined borders. Morpheaform BCCs may resemble a scar or plaque of morphea. The lesion's surface is typically smooth, although crusts with underlying erosions or ulcerations, as well as superimposed papules, may be observed. Telangiectasias also may be present. The biologic behavior is usually more aggressive, with extensive local destruction."
Benign keratosis-like lesions,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482439/,"[Bookshelf](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/ ""Bookshelf home"")",Evaluation,"A qualified practitioner should perform a complete skin examination since individuals with one finding of skin cancer often have additional cancers or pre-cancers at other sites and have an increased risk of developing malignant melanoma. Documentation of the location of the lesions with photographs or digital images is a recommended procedure. There is a low threshold for obtaining skin biopsies in these patients. Preoperative imaging studies may be necessary when there is suspicion of parotid gland, muscle, deep soft tissue, orbital, bone involvement, or perineural invasion. Patients with a history of BCC should have long-term, even lifetime, follow-up, particularly those with multiple or high-risk tumors. Dermoscopy can be beneficial to the experienced clinician, aiding in the diagnosis of non-pigmented and pigmented BCCs. The hallmark of BCC on dermoscopy is the presence of well-focused arborizing vessels. Additional findings include multiple blue-gray globules, leaf-like structures, large blue-gray ovoid nests, and spoke-wheel areas. There is no pigment network, as one would see with dermoscopy of pigmented lesions."

Nodular BCC may be confused with trichoblastoma or trichoepithelioma. Superficial BCC may mimic some inflammatory dermatoses such as psoriasis and eczema. Morphea-like BCC may be confused with a plaque of morphea or a scar. In these cases, histopathological helps to establish the diagnosis of BCC."

On this page [show] [hide] Cancers of the skin (most of which are basal and squamous cell skin cancers) are by far the most common of all types of cancer in the United States. According to one estimate, about 5.4 million basal and squamous cell skin cancers are diagnosed each year in the US (occurring in about 3.3 million people, as some people have more than one). About 8 out of 10 of these are basal cell cancers. Squamous cell cancers occur less often. The number of these cancers has been increasing for many years. This is probably from a combination of better skin cancer detection, people getting more sun exposure, and people living longer. Although basal and squamous cell skin cancers are common, deaths from these cancers are not. For the US, estimates have ranged from about 2,000 to about 8,000 people each year (mostly from squamous cell skin cancer). Most people who die from these cancers are older and may not have seen a doctor until the cancer has already grown quite large. Other people more likely to die of these cancers include those whose immune system is suppressed, such as people who have had organ transplants or are being treated for autoimmune diseases such as lupus or rheumatoid arthritis. The exact number of people in the US who develop or die from basal and squamous cell skin cancers each year isn't known for sure. Unlike most other types of cancer, basal and squamous cell skin cancers are not reported to and tracked by cancer registries. 1.

Although it rarely results in death or metastatic disease, BCC can cause significant morbidity due to destructive local spread. The accessibility of skin and the high prevalence of BCC have allowed a thorough characterization of pathogenesis, clinical presentation, and histopathology. Management remains largely surgical in the form of electrodesiccation and curettage, surgical excision, and Mohs surgery. Topical therapies are effective for the treatment of certain low-risk BCCs. Radiation therapy is an option when surgery is contraindicated. Knowledge of the genetic changes underlying BCC has paved the way for the development of targeted therapies for advanced disease."

The preferred technique is one cycle of electrofulguration followed by curettage. Many dermatologists do not favor the use of ED&C for the treatment of low-risk primary BCC on the face for a variety of reasons. First, it may result in an unattractive, hypopigmented scar. Second, recurrent BCCs initially treated with ED&C grow within scar tissue and may have a more aggressive biological behavior, potentially causing significant destruction."

A study of 1,039 BCCs correlated the various histologic patterns with adequacy of margins of surgical excision. Nodular and superficial BCCs were completely removed by conventional surgical excision in a high percentage of cases (94 percent and 96 percent, respectively). In contrast, micronodular, infiltrative, and morpheaform BCCs had a high incidence of positive tumor margins (19 percent, 26 percent, and 33 percent, respectively). In summary, surgical excision is effective for most primary BCCs on the trunk or extremities where conservation of tissue is not a priority."

Treatment can result in a hypopigmented scar and a high recurrence rate. Intralesional injection of pro-inflammatory agents is a practically obsolete method formerly used to treat certain BCCs. Intralesional injection of interferon-α-2b has been shown to be effective for the treatment of superficial and nodular BCCs but involved frequent painful injections over 3 weeks. Topical imiquimod is much simpler to use than intralesional agents and achieves similar results."

Basal cell carcinoma,https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/issues/2020/0915/p339.html,Basal Cell and Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinomas: Diagnosis and Treatment,Article Sections,"Keratinocyte carcinoma, traditionally referred to as nonmelanoma skin cancer, includes basal cell and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and is the most common skin cancer malignancy found in humans. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends counseling about minimizing exposure to ultraviolet radiation for people aged six months to 24 years with fair skin types to decrease their risk of skin cancer. Routine screening for skin cancer is controversial. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force concludes that current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of a routine whole-body skin examination to screen for skin cancer. Basal cell carcinoma commonly appears as a shiny, pearly papule with a smooth surface, rolled borders, and arborizing telangiectatic surface vessels. Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma commonly appears as a firm, smooth, or hyperkeratotic papule or plaque, and may have central ulceration. Initial tissue sampling for diagnosis is a shave technique if the lesion is raised, or a punch biopsy of the most abnormal-appearing area of skin. High-risk factors for recurrence and metastasis include prior tumors, ill-defined borders, aggressive histologic patterns, and perineural invasion. Mohs micrographic surgery has the lowest recurrence rate among treatments but is best considered for large, high-risk tumors or tumors in sensitive anatomic locations. Smaller, lower-risk tumors are treated with surgical excision, electrodesiccation and curettage, or cryotherapy. Topical imiquimod and fluorouracil are also treatment options for superficial basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma in situ. There are no clear guidelines for follow up after an index keratinocyte carcinoma, but monitoring for recurrence is important because the five-year risk of subsequent skin cancer is 41%. After more than one diagnosis, the five-year risk increases to 82%."

Basal cell carcinoma,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1326020023012219,,Methods:,"We linked records from QSkin Study participants (n=37,103) to Medicare. We measured the proportion of Medicare claims for primary excision of BCC/SCC that had corresponding claims for histopathology services. In subsets of participants, we estimated the sensitivity and external concordance of MBS item numbers for identifying BCC/SCC diagnoses by comparing against ‘gold‐standard’ histopathology reports."
Basal cell carcinoma,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1326020023012219,,Results:,"A total of 2,821 (7.6%) participants had 4,830 separate Medicare claims for BCC/SCC excision; almost all (97%) had contemporaneous Medicare claims for histopathology services. Among participants with BCC/SCC confirmed by histology reports, 76% had a corresponding Medicare claim for primary surgical excision of BCC/SCC. External concordance for Medicare claims for primary BCC/SCC excision was 68%, increasing to 97% when diagnoses for intra‐epidermal carcinomas and keratoacanthomas were included."
Basal cell carcinoma,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1326020023012219,,Conclusions:,"MBS item numbers for primary excision of BCC/SCC are reasonably reliable for determining incident cases of keratinocyte skin cancers, but may underestimate incidence by up to 24%."

As the nodule expands beyond 1 cm the center can begin to break down causing an ulcer surrounded by a rolled edge. The alternative name for this is ""rodent ulcer"". Nodular basal cell carcinomas are common on the face, particularly along embryonal fusion planes such as the inner canthus, perinasal skin and periauricular skin. They can occur anywhere on the body that has been subject to intermittent severe sun exposure. Childhood exposure appears to be of considerable significance, as it is for melanoma, in the development of basal cell carcinoma."

It consists of shallow plaques, pink to almost skin coloured, that slowly expand over many years. The shallowness of the lesion prevents ulceration until quite late. Typically, these lesions are very friable, and minor trauma such as dragging a fingernail across the lesion while often result in multiple pinpoint bleeding areas. Superficial spreading basal cell carcinomas are almost all secondary to sun damage."

The early lesion can look like a small white scar on the skin. This scar-like area slowly expands. Nodules of basal cell carcinoma can be apparent in late lesions but the sclerotic scarred area can expand to a very large size before it is clinically obvious as a skin cancer. It is most common on the face, and can produce quite significant morbidity because of its size at the time of diagnosis. Because the margins of sclerosing basal cell carcinoma are almost always very poorly defined, it is commonly recurrent after simple surgical excision. Micrographic surgery, if available, is the surgical treatment of choice or, in patients over 60, radiation therapy with generous margins. In all cases, the lesion must be examined carefully under very good light to ascertain the approximate margins."

Nodular basal cell carcinomas can be pigmented, as can superficial spreading basal cell carcinomas. Nodular basal cell carcinomas that are pigmented may be confused clinically with nodular melanoma. The differentiating feature, if completely pigmented, is that there are pigment flecks around the base of the nodule that are absent in melanoma. These flecks are the engorged melanocytes. In many cases the only way to clearly differentiate is a biopsy."

Basal cell carcinoma,https://bestpractice.bmj.com/topics/en-us/269,Basal cell carcinoma,Summary,"Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) clinically presents as a pearly white/pink papulo-nodule or firm plaque. Patient usually has prominent solar damage or a history of considerable ultraviolet (UV) radiation exposure. Can be locally aggressive, but rarely metastasizes. Diagnosis of a cancer is histologic. Findings are of dermal masses of varying sizes and shapes composed of basophilic cells with large oval rather uniform nuclei and scant cytoplasm. These masses exhibit a peripheral cell layer demonstrating a palisading pattern of nuclei. Most BCCs are successfully treated with surgery, with low recurrence rates."

It is more accurately called a lobular capillary hemangioma. The lesion grossly appears as a solitary, red, pedunculated papule that is very friable. Less commonly, it may present as a sessile plaque. It shows rapid exophytic growth, with a surface that often undergoes ulceration. This is often seen on cutaneous or mucosal surfaces. Among the latter, it is most commonly seen within the oral cavity. Rarely, it may occur at other sites within the gastrointestinal tract. This activity orients the interprofessional team to this entity and helps them recognize, evaluate, and manage this condition."

Basal cell carcinoma,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK556077/,"[Bookshelf](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/ ""Bookshelf home"")",History and Physical,"A lobular capillary hemangioma typically starts as a small, red papule; then it undergoes a variable, sometimes rapid, exophytic growth phase over weeks to months, eventually stabilizing in size. The color may vary from red to reddish-brown or purple. The diameter varies from a few millimeters for small lesions to several centimeters for larger lesions. Lesions are typically solitary, but satellite lesions may develop in proximity, and sometimes disseminated lesions may be noted. Mature lesions are polypoid or pedunculated and have a ""collarette"" of scale at the base of the lesion. This epidermal collarette may help identify the lesion, but it is not unique to this entity and may be seen in other conditions that show lesions erupting rapidly through the epidermis. Sessile lesions are rare. The surface is often friable, and the lesion can show profuse bleeding with even minor trauma. Bleeding is recurrent due to unavoidable trauma and may become difficult to control. Patients present to the clinic with band-aids applied over the lesions, an attempt to prevent trauma and bleeding from the lesion – colloquially termed the ""band-aid sign."" A summary of certain clinical variants of lobular capillary hemangioma is described below: * Digital or periungual pyogenic granulomas, which may be solitary or multiple: * A solitary periungual pyogenic granuloma may mimic other periungual lesions, such as acute paronychia, and occur secondary to acute or chronic local trauma or infection."

Benign lesions that may need to be distinguished from lobular capillary hemangiomas include: * Hemangiomas * Irritated melanocytic nevi * Spitz nevus * Warts * An acquired digital fibrokeratoma * Granulation tissue from minor trauma or scratching * Glomus tumor * Angiolymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia"

Basal cell carcinoma,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK556077/,"[Bookshelf](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/ ""Bookshelf home"")",Deterrence and Patient Education,Patients typically need reassurance for this condition since they may be worried about more sinister conditions. They should be discouraged from scratching or picking at the lesion and must take some precautions to avoid trauma or secondary infection. They should be advised about the risk of recurrence with partial excisions and the risk of scarring with a total surgical excision. The decision of which modality to use for the lesion must be arrived at jointly by the patient and their physician.

Given their somewhat abrupt onset, patients may present in various settings such as urgent care, primary care, pediatric clinics, dermatology clinics, and podiatry clinics or sometimes even seek an oncologist or surgeon. As these lesions are common in children, pregnant women, and patients on certain medications, a strong link with specialists such as a dermatologist is needed for the appropriate treatment of these lesions by a suitable modality. When these lesions are excised, partially or wholly, specimens must always be sent for histopathologic assessment to rule out red-flag diagnoses."

On worsening of his anemia, and with decreasing serum ferritin and iron saturation levels, he was diagnosed with iron deficiency anemia and a GI source of blood loss was suspected. Diagnostic esophagogastroduodenoscopy, colonoscopy and small bowel follow-through did not reveal the source of bleeding. A technetium 99m-tagged red blood cell scan was performed and suggested bleeding in the right upper quadrant; however, the source was not clearly identified as being in the large or small bowel."

Rarely, these lesions can be associated with overt bleeding and are very rarely life-threatening. PG may be amenable to endoscopic diagnosis, given its unusual colour and distinct white film coating. Once diagnosed, endoscopic polypectomy appears to be as equally effective and safe as surgical excision and, therefore, should be considered the therapy of choice. PG should be added to the list of luminal disorders that can be responsible for GI bleeding."

The most common sites involved are the fingers and face. Pyogenic granuloma easily bleeds with minor trauma. Oral mucosal pyogenic granulomas typically develop on the lip and gums (gingiva) as pedunculated or sessile slow-growing painless red papules ranging in size from a few millimetres to several centimetres.

However, tissue may be submitted for histology following surgical treatment of the lesion or where there are concerns about the diagnosis. Histology of pyogenic granuloma shows a prominent lobular capillary arrangement in the dermis. The overlying epidermis may be thinned or ulcerated, and the peripheral collarette is formed by elongated rete ridges and eccrine ducts. Inflammatory changes and signs of haemorrhage are secondary. Dermal lobular arrangement of capillaries There are two distinct histological types of oral pyogenic granuloma. In addition to the lobular capillary haemangioma pattern, a second type shows a distinct granulation tissue-like vascular proliferation which is postulated to have a different aetiology and evolution."

Pyogenic granulomas and hemorrhage,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0736467922003055,,Introduction,"Pyogenic granulomas (lobular capillary hemangiomas) are benign vascular tumors commonly seen in the pediatric population (Figure 1). They often present as individual, painless red or violaceous papules on the skin or mucous membranes, though involvement of other tissues has been described (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9). The majority of pyogenic granulomas in children are located on the face, head, and neck (3,4,10,11). Studies have estimated the prevalence of pyogenic granulomas to be approximately 1%, and the mean age of onset is approximately 6 to 7 years (1,3,4). The exact etiology of pyogenic granulomas is unknown; however, trauma, medications (e.g., isotretinoin, paclitaxel), pregnancy, and infections all have been associated with the development of these lesions (1,2,4,5,12). Pyogenic granulomas often arise rapidly over the course of several weeks, and many patients typically present with a solitary lesion (1,4). Pyogenic granuloma papules are often 1 mm to 10 mm in diameter and may become crusted or verrucous in appearance over time (1,3,4). Some lesions will eventually involute over the course of several months. Though many pyogenic granulomas are asymptomatic, ulceration and bleeding may occur, especially after minor trauma. Observational studies have described bleeding in ≤60% to 80% of children with pyogenic granulomas (3,4). The bleeding can be profuse and difficult for caretakers to stop, prompting presentation to urgent care centers and emergency departments (EDs). Spontaneous regression of some pyogenic granulomas in children has been reported over the course of 6 to 18 months, though others may persist for years to decades (3, 4, 5). For pyogenic granulomas associated with a specific inciting agent, such as a medication or pregnancy, regression is usually associated with discontinuation of the stimulus (1,5). As most pyogenic granulomas are often removed for cosmetic reasons or because of bleeding, the natural course of the lesion has been difficult to characterize. Although most commonly a clinical diagnosis, pyogenic granulomas can also be identified through histology (4,5,13,14). Recurrent lesions or those that do not bleed should be sent for histologic analysis because the differential diagnosis of pyogenic granulomas includes conditions such as amelanotic melanoma, angiosarcoma, Kaposi sarcoma, bacillary angiomatosis, and granulation tissue (1,5)."
Pyogenic granulomas and hemorrhage,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0736467922003055,,Conventional Management,"Multiple management options exist to address pyogenic granulomas and can be broadly divided into surgical and nonsurgical modalities (4,15, 16, 17). Surgical options include excision, curettage or shave excision, and punch excision (15,16). Surgical options have the benefit of allowing histologic examination of the removed tissue to confirm the diagnosis. Adjuncts used during surgical management may include cautery, often with silver nitrate, or laser photocoagulation (11,16,18). Ligation of"
Pyogenic granulomas and hemorrhage,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0736467922003055,,Conclusions,"Many options are available to emergency physicians to manage persistently bleeding pyogenic granulomas (Figure 3). Direct pressure, even if attempted before arrival at the ED, remains first-line treatment. The use of a nonadherent dressing combined with prolonged direct pressure may be adequate to achieve hemostasis. If bleeding persists, direct pressure should be reattempted with dressings impregnated with topical vasoconstrictors or with a commercially available hemostatic dressing or agent."

The skin condition has also been linked to the use of certain types of medications, including: * Retinoids (vitamin A compounds often used to improve or heal skin)."
Pyogenic granulomas and hemorrhage,https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/22717-pyogenic-granuloma,Pyogenic Granuloma,Where do pyogenic granulomas occur?,"They can appear anywhere on your skin or mucous membranes. Mucous membranes are thin linings of cavities and canals that leave your body. Examples include the lining of your mouth and nose. Common sites for pyogenic granulomas are: * Face. * Mouth (gums), lips, tongue or nose. * Fingers and toes."
Pyogenic granulomas and hemorrhage,https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/22717-pyogenic-granuloma,Pyogenic Granuloma,What does a pyogenic granuloma look like?,"A pyogenic granuloma starts as a small, fleshy bump protruding from your skin or mucous membranes. It usually grows quickly, from a few millimeters (the tip of a crayon) to about a half-inch (the tip of a finger). Pyogenic granulomas have been described as looking like ground beef. They may be pink, red, reddish-brown or purple. They often develop a scaly, white “collar” around the bottom. At maturity, the growths are often attached to your skin by a stalk-like structure (pedunculated). But they can also attach directly to your skin (sessile). The surface of a pyogenic granuloma starts smooth but can become bumpy or crusty. The lesions are delicate, so they ooze, break and bleed easily."

Pyogenic granulomas and hemorrhage,https://thischangedmypractice.com/pyogenic-granulomas/,Pyogenic granulomas,What changed my practice,"In 2014, a group of investigators demonstrated that the use of a topical beta blocker, timolol, three times a day on lesions of pyogenic granulomas, significantly reduced the size of pyogenic granulomas over the course of weeks to months and was effective in stopping further bleeding episodes (3). B-blocker therapy was offered to patients with recurrent pyogenic granulomas and those whom were hesitant to undergo removal procedures. Six patients with pyogenic granulomas of the skin opted for treatment with topical β-blocker therapy. An additional patient with a mucosal pyogenic granuloma who had not responded to multiple treatment modalities was treated using systemic propranolol. Response times were variable, but all lesions treated showed at least a partial response by 2 months. In cases that presented with bleeding, treatment with topical timolol resolved further bleeding almost immediately. In many cases the bleeding was the patient’s main concern, and resolution of the bleeding led to high patient satisfaction with the treatment. Considerable interest in the use of beta blockers for vascular lesions started when Leaute-Labreze et al reported the efficacy of oral propranolol in the treatment of hemangiomas of infancy. Subsequently, studies on topical β-blockers, such as timolol, demonstrated a positive effect in the treatment of a subset of hemangiomas. Beta-adrenergic receptors on vascular endothelial cells cause peripheral vasodilation, activate proangiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), and inhibit endothelial cell apoptosis. Blocking these actions may help explain the effectiveness of topical timolol in pyogenic granulomas. The variable effect and time to resolution of pyogenic granulomas treated with topical timolol may be explained by the fact that pyogenic granulomas have a weaker expression of three critical beta-adrenergic receptors. Since timolol is a hydrophilic molecule, there is poor percutaneous absorption with a very low risk of systemic effects."

Clinically, actinic keratoses present as macules, papules, or hyperkeratotic plaques with an erythematous background that occur on photoexposed areas. At initial stages, they may be better identified by palpation rather than by visual inspection. They may also be pigmented and show variable degrees of infiltration; when multiple they then constitute the so-called field cancerization. Their prevalence ranges from 11% to 60% in Caucasian individuals above 40 years. Ultraviolet radiation is the main factor involved in pathogenesis, but individual factors also play a role in the predisposing to lesions appearance. Diagnosis of lesions is based on clinical and dermoscopic examination, but in some situations histopathological analysis may be necessary. The risk of transformation into squamous cell carcinoma is the major concern regarding actinic keratoses. Therapeutic modalities for actinic keratoses include topical medications, and ablative and surgical methods; the best treatment option should always be individualized according to the patient. **Keywords:** Dermoscopy; Keratosis, actinic; Neoplasms, squamous cell; Precancerous conditions; Skin neoplasms"

The latter point is a matter of considerable debate, and the most robust studies (Cochrane review) did not find convincing evidence that AK treatment resulted in a prevention of invasive squamous cell carcinomas. Treatment of an actinic keratosis requires removal of the defective skin cells. Epidermis regenerates from surrounding or follicular keratinocytes that have escaped sun damage. Some AKs will resolve with the frequent and appropriate use of sunscreens. Tender, thickened, ulcerated, or enlarging actinic keratoses should be treated aggressively. Asymptomatic flat keratoses may not require active treatment but should be kept under observation."

Ingenol mebutate has demonstrated efficacy in field treatment of actinic keratosis. However, molecular mechanisms on ingenol mebutate response are not yet fully understood. In this study, we evaluated the gene expression profiles of actinic keratosis lesions before and after treatment with ingenol mebutate using microarray technology. Actinic keratoses on face/scalp of 15 immunocompetent patients were identified and evaluated after treatment with topical ingenol mebutate gel 0.015%, applied once daily for 3 consecutive days. Diagnostic and clearance of lesions was determined by clinical, dermoscopic, and reflectance confocal microscopy criteria. Lesional and non-lesional skin biopsies were subjected to gene expression analysis profiled by Affymetrix microarray. Differentially expressed genes were identified, and enrichment analyses were performed using STRING database. At 8 weeks post-treatment, 60% of patients responded to ingenol mebutate therapy, achieving complete clearance in 40% of cases. A total of 128 differentially expressed genes were identified following treatment, and downregulated genes (114 of 128) revealed changes in pathways important to epidermal development, keratinocyte differentiation and cornification. In responder patients, 388 downregulated genes (of 450 differentially expressed genes) were also involved in development/differentiation of the epidermis, and immune system-related pathways, such as cytokine and interleukin signaling. Cluster analysis revealed two relevant clusters showing upregulated profile patterns in pre-treatment actinic keratoses of responders, as compared to non-responders. Again, differentially expressed genes were mainly associated with cornification, keratinization and keratinocyte differentiation. Overall, the present study provides insight into the gene expression profile of actinic keratoses after treatment with ingenol mebutate, as well as identification of genetic signatures that could predict treatment response."

Our study included clinical and dermoscopic evaluations together with a monitoring of the histological patterns of AKs by _in vivo_ reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM), a non-invasive imaging technique. We also performed a comparative analysis of gene expression profiles of AKs responsive and unresponsive to the study treatment, in order to gain a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved and to identify potential genetic signatures of response to IM therapy."

AK lesions larger than 8 mm in diameter were identified, evaluated, and subsequently monitored at the pre-treatment visit (visit 1), at 4±2 days after treatment (visit 2), and at 8±1 weeks after treatment (visit 3). Clinical assessment of AKs and photographs with a digital camera (Canon Powershot G10®, Ōita, Japan) were made at each study visit. At visits 1 and 3, dermoscopic images (DermliteFoto®, 3Gen, San Juan Capistrano, CA, USA) and RCM images of the skin lesional sites were also obtained."

Within each AK treatment area, two areas were selected for biopsy before and after treatment. One of them was biopsied at visit 1 (pre-treatment biopsy: AK-PRE), and the other one at visit 3 (post-treatment biopsy: AK-POST). A biopsy from the axilla or retro-auricular area (non-lesional non-sun-exposed skin: NSES) and a biopsy from a sun-exposed peri-lesional area (within 5 cm peri-lesional: SES) were also obtained at visit 1. Location of the selected treatment areas as well as biopsy locations were verified by referencing the transparency on which they were mapped. All biopsies were 4-mm skin punch biopsies −performed under local anesthesia−, and were subjected to gene expression analysis profiled by Affymetrix microarray. After performing AK-PRE biopsy, biopsy wounds were allowed to heal for two weeks. Then, participants were instructed to treat the healed skin area with IM gel 0.015% (Picato®, LEO Pharma, Ballerup, Denmark), applied once daily for 3 consecutive days in the affected area, covering both clinical AK and the area surrounding the lesions."

Total RNA from frozen OCT-embedded samples was extracted using mirVana miRNA Isolation kit (Ambion, Life Technologies, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After extraction, purity and integrity of the RNA were assessed by spectrophotometry and nanoelectrophoresis using the NanoDrop ND-2000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies, USA) and the Nano lab-on-a-chip assay for total eukaryotic RNA using Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent Technologies, USA), respectively. All samples had good purity and integrity and were subsequently used for microarray hybridization and qRT-PCR confirmation."

Actinic keratoses and intraepithelial carcinomae,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actinic_keratosis,Actinic keratosis,Photodynamic therapy,"Treatment begins with preparation of the lesion, which includes scraping away scales and crusts using a dermal curette. A thick layer of topical MAL or 5-ALA cream is applied to the lesion and a small area surrounding the lesion, which is then covered with an occlusive dressing and left for a period of time. During this time the photosensitizer accumulates in the target cells within the AK lesion. The dressings are then removed and the lesion is treated with light at a specified wavelength."

Enhanced understanding of the pathophysiologic changes leading from AK to malignancy, combined with an increasing global prevalence of AK, has led to a new focus on the importance of combining local tretments that remove individual lesions with topical or procedural field therapies that treat the entire actinically damaged field — also known as field cancerization — which is important because it is impossible to predict which AK lesions will progress to SCC. Currently available topical field therapies include 5-fluorouracil cream (5%, 1%, 0.5%), imiquimod cream (5% and 3.75%), diclofenac sodium gel 3% with 2.5% hyaluronic gel, and ingenol mebutate gel (0.05% and 0.015%). Photodynamic therapy is a procedural field therapy. Important considerations when developing a comprehensive treatment plan include patient risk factors; the number and location of AK lesions; strategies for minimizing sun exposure; and the mechanism of action, clearance rate, adverse effect profile, and application of local and topical therapies. _J Drugs Dermatol 2012_ ;11(12):1462-1467."

RCM Diagnosis of AK,"Clinically distinguishing between AKs, SCCs in situ, and their variants can be difficult. Additionally, skin biopsy, a common method for diagnosis, is invasive and complicates the monitoring of the same lesion post-treatment. However, these challenges might be mitigated through the use of RCM. **Figure 2.** Reflectance confocal microscopy aspects of actinic keratosis at the level of spinous and granular layers—atypical honeycomb patterns with keratinocytes variable in size and morphology (blue arrows) (**a** –**c**); small hyperreflective cells corresponding to inflammatory cells (orange arrows) (**a** ,**c**); Images from the personal library of VMV obtained with the VivaScope handheld 3000 device. **Figure 3.** Reflectance confocal microscopy aspects of actinic keratosis at the level of dermis; hyperreflective collagen bundles which interconnects in a disarray pattern (green arrow); moderately refractive lace-like material adjacent to collagen bundles; small bright cells corresponding to inflammatory cells (orange arrows); dilated blood vessels.

Images from the personal library of Voiculescu VM obtained using the Dermus Vision Device (Skin Aid Software, 2023). In recent times, non-invasive methods like dermoscopy, reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM), and optical coherence tomography (OCT) have been developed to effectively monitor and diagnose actinic keratoses (AKs). However, their high costs and limited depth of penetration, which may result in incomplete lesion assessment, restrict their widespread use in everyday clinical practice. In contrast, high-frequency ultrasound (HFUS) is advantageous due to its affordability, ease of use, repeatability, real-time imaging capability, non-invasiveness, and versatility. HFUS can provide detailed images of skin layers and deeper structures, making it a valuable tool for diagnosing suspected skin cancers and aiding in treatment decisions."

Conclusions,"Actinic keratoses are responsible for a large impact on healthcare systems world-wide, both through the unpredictable potential of malignant transformation and the need for treatments with potential local complications. Non-invasive imaging techniques (dermoscopy, reflectance confocal microscopy) not only allow the identification of clear criteria to establish a diagnosis, but also offer the dermatologist the opportunity to closely follow-up the cancerization field, as well as the different stages of local treatment, with the aim of establishing an end-point of treatment. Although still at the beginning, ultrasonographic imaging techniques (high frequency ultrasonography and dermoscopy guided ultrasonography) look promising and are able to complement the formerly mentioned through a different visualization plane, as well as through better in-depth penetration. However, they are still new techniques at the beginning of their journey, for which studies on large groups of patients are needed in order to establish clear criteria for the diagnosis and staging of AK. At the present time, reflectance confocal microscopy remains the imaging technique with the closest specificity and sensitivity to histopathological examination in the diagnosis and monitoring of these lesions."

The term ""fibrous histiocytoma"" primarily describes the morphologic appearance of the cell populations forming these lesions rather than solely indicating the cellular lineage. Clinically, these mesenchymal cell lesions of the dermis are commonly found on the extremities and are relatively small, typically measuring 1 cm or less in diameter. Dermatofibromas are prevalent across all age groups; however, they are more frequently observed in individuals aged 20 to 50, especially among females."
Actinic keratoses and intraepithelial carcinomae,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK470538/,"[Bookshelf](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/ ""Bookshelf home"")",Etiology,"The nature of dermatofibroma as either a reactive process or a true neoplasm remains unclear. Although the exact cause of the condition remains unknown, it is common for patients presenting with a dermatofibroma to report a history of local trauma at the site, such as from an insect bite, minor injuries, a rose thorn injury, or a superficial puncture wound, but not consistently. While patients diagnosed with dermatofibroma often report a history of local trauma, suggesting a reactive process, such trauma is not consistently reported and is found in only about one-fifth of cases. More often, dermatofibromas develop spontaneously without any specific inciting event or trauma. Spontaneous regression is rare, which may argue against a primarily reactive process and instead support a clonal or neoplastic model."
Actinic keratoses and intraepithelial carcinomae,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK470538/,"[Bookshelf](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/ ""Bookshelf home"")",Histopathology,"The most commonly diagnosed histologic variant of dermatofibroma is the common fibrous histiocytoma, also known as common dermatofibroma. Histopathologically, common dermatofibroma is characterized by a localized proliferation of spindle-shaped fibrous cells mixed with histiocytoid cells within the dermis. Typically nodular in appearance, these proliferations exhibit spiculated but moderately defined borders that may appear to push against surrounding tissue. The spindle cells may form a focal storiform pattern characterized by a multicentric whorling appearance of elongated nuclei. Intermixed capillaries, lymphocytes, or multinucleated giant cells may also be present. While these proliferations typically remain within the dermis, it is common to observe a small portion of the lesion extending into the subcutaneous tissue along septal lines. A distinguishing characteristic of dermatofibroma is the presence of trapped collagen bundles or collagen balls within and between the fascicles of spindled fibrous cells. These entrapped collagen collections are frequently located at the periphery of the lesion. A delineated and unaffected zone typically separates the overlying epidermis—the Grenz zone. Reactive changes in the epidermis commonly include hyperkeratosis and acanthosis. Additionally, the epidermis often displays elongated rete ridges extending into the dermis, with hyperpigmented basal keratinocytes, a feature referred to as the ""dirty-feet sign."""

This variant typically presents as blue, red, or purple papules commonly found on the lower extremities. These lesions are often clinically misdiagnosed as vascular lesions. Histologically, they consist of spindle-like cells with interspersed collagen bundles and typically exhibit blood-filled tissue spaces along with hemosiderin deposition in the surrounding cells. In patients with 2 or more simultaneously occurring dermatofibromas, the lesions typically appear histopathologically similar, despite the existence of multiple histologic benign variants of dermatofibroma."
Actinic keratoses and intraepithelial carcinomae,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK470538/,"[Bookshelf](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/ ""Bookshelf home"")",History and Physical,"Dermatofibromas are slow-growing lesions that can develop on any part of the body, although they commonly affect the extremities. Clinically, they present as firm, nontender cutaneous nodules with or without accompanying skin changes, such as tan-pink to reddish-brown discoloration, which may vary depending on the age of the lesion. Typically, dermatofibromas measure 1 cm or less in diameter, but larger lesions exceeding 3 cm in diameter have been documented."
Actinic keratoses and intraepithelial carcinomae,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK470538/,"[Bookshelf](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/ ""Bookshelf home"")",Differential Diagnosis,"Differentiating benign dermatofibromas from more advanced and aggressive neoplasms that may mimic their appearance is crucial. **Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans:** DFSP is a locally aggressive neoplasm of low-to-intermediate grade that can resemble a benign dermatofibroma. An early lesion of DFSP may manifest as an indurated skin-colored nodule that gradually enlarges over months to years. A histopathological examination is essential for accurate diagnosis, as several distinguishing features exist. DFSP is characteristically more cellular and tends to involve a greater extent of the subcutis, often displaying a ""honeycomb"" entrapment of subcutaneous fat. Immunohistochemical staining can be particularly helpful in challenging cases, as DFSP typically stains positive for CD34 and negative for factor XIIIa. In contrast, benign dermatofibromas will stain strongly positive for factor XIIIa but negative for CD34. Additionally, dermatofibromas may exhibit higher positive staining for D2-40. Ki-67 staining should indicate a much higher proliferation index in DFSP, and the mitotic rate should also be significantly higher in DFSP compared to dermatofibroma. **Kaposi sarcoma:** Kaposi sarcoma is characterized by spindled cell proliferation within the dermis and may be confused with the aneurysmal variant of dermatofibroma. Kaposi sarcoma typically exhibits red blood cells between spindled cellular areas and vascularity. However, Kaposi sarcoma should test positive for human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8) and may also stain positive for CD31, CD34, and D2-40. **Intradermal nevi:** Intradermal nevi typically have a softer consistency than dermatofibromas and do not exhibit dimpling upon pinching. **Keratoacanthomas:** Keratoacanthomasare characterized by a rapid growth rate and often display a central keratinous plug."

To review the mainfeaturesof these variants, a retrospective study of skin biopsies and tissue excisions of dermatofibromasperformed in the dermatology and venereology service at the Hospital Garcia de Orta between May 2007 and April 2012 was carried out. During that period, 192 dermatofibromas were diagnosed in 181 patients, the lesions being more common in women. Median age of the study population was 48 years. The most common lesion site was the limbs (74% of patients). The histopathological types found were common fibrous histiocytoma (80%) and the aneurysmal (5.7%),hemosiderotic (5.7%), epithelioid (2.6%), cellular (2.1%), lipidized (2.1%), atrophic (1.0) and clear cell (0.5%) variants.

Dermatofibroma,https://anndermatol.org/DOIx.php?id=10.5021%2Fad.2011.23.2.185,Annals of Dermatology,Objective,We wanted to evaluate the clinical and pathologic characteristics of 122 cases of dermatofibromas.
Dermatofibroma,https://anndermatol.org/DOIx.php?id=10.5021%2Fad.2011.23.2.185,Annals of Dermatology,Methods,We retrospectively reviewed the medical records and 122 biopsy specimens of 92 patients who were diagnosed with dermatofibroma in the Department of Dermatology at Eulji Hospital of Eulji University between January 2000 and March 2010.
Dermatofibroma,https://anndermatol.org/DOIx.php?id=10.5021%2Fad.2011.23.2.185,Annals of Dermatology,Results,"Nearly 80% of the cases occurred between the ages of 20 and 49 years, with an overall predominance of females. Over 70% of the lesions were found on the extremities. The most common histologic variant was a fibrocollagenous dermatofibroma (40.1%). Other variants included histiocytic (13.1%), cellular (11.5%), aneurysmal (7.4%), angiomatous (6.5%), sclerotic (6.5%), monster (4.9%), palisading (1.6%) and keloidal dermatofibromas (0.8%). There were 9 dermatofibromas (7.3%) that were the mixed type with two co-dominant histologic features."

Dermatofibroma,https://anndermatol.org/DOIx.php?id=10.5021%2Fad.2011.23.2.185,Annals of Dermatology,Histopathologic features,"All of the cutaneous samples were fixed in formalin, processed and embedded in paraffin. The sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. The samples were classified as variants of dermatofibromas (fibrocollagenous, sclerotic, cellular, histiocytic, aneurysmal, angiomatous, keloidal, monster, palisading and mixed) according to the dominant pathologic features. When the cellular type of dermatofibroma was suspected, immunohistochemical staining (CD34 and factor XIIIa) was performed to differentiate it from a dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP). In addition, the depth of invasion, the epidermal changes (hyperkeratosis, acanthosis and basal layer hyperpigmentation), the presence of a grenz zone, formation of lymphoid nodules and mucin deposition were determined."

The most commonly reported stains were CD34, SMA, S100, and FXIIIa. Most studies applied IHC either to explore descriptive features of DF or DFSP or to determine their utility in diagnostic identification of the lesions. A number of studies applied novel biomarkers which may hold promise for distinguishing DF and DFSP, namely WT1, Cx43, LSP-1, and PHH3, which demonstrated considerable expression differences between the two lesions. This review highlights the need for validation of existing and emerging IHC markers for the diagnosis of DF and DFSP."

INTRODUCTION,"However, despite the elaborate use of IHC in classifying and studying DF and DFSP, the diagnostic specificity of the currently employed markers is imperfect. Although a number of novel markers have been suggested, constantly emerging literature coupled with a lack of validated data can lead to confusion about which markers are the most effective. For this reason, we conducted a scoping review of the literature in order to systematically report IHC staining data on these lesions, summarize the utility of existing markers, and highlight emerging markers specifically useful for distinguishing DF and DFSP. An effective summary of the current literature on the IHC staining profiles of these lesions is useful for consolidating information and providing insight into prospective biomarkers which require additional validation."

Conclusions,"In this review, we report the IHC expression in DF and DFSP of traditional diagnostic markers as well as novel markers which may hold diagnostic utility according to the literature from the past 10 years. Of the markers discussed with diagnostic relevance, traditional markers such as CD34, SMA, and FXIIIa were the most common and demonstrated expected expression patterns in DF and DFSP. Additionally, studies investigated novel markers for distinguishing DF and DFSP such as WT1, Cx43, LSP-1, and PHH3/Ki-67. Future studies should seek to continue investigating the expression of these markers and their potential utility for diagnostic application."

Dermatofibroma,https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4418/13/4/671,Challenging Patterns of Atypical Dermatofibromas and Promising Diagnostic Tools for Differential Diagnosis of Malignant Lesions,Abstract,"Dermatofibroma (DF) or fibrous histiocytoma is one of the most frequent benign cutaneous soft-tissue lesions, characterized by a post-inflammatory tissue reaction associated with fibrosis of the dermis. Clinically DFs have a polymorphous clinical aspect from the solitary, firm, single nodules to multiple papules with a relatively smooth surface. However, multiple atypical clinicopathological variants of DFs have been reported and, therefore, clinical recognition may become challenging, leading to a more burdensome identification and sometimes to misdiagnosis. Dermoscopy is considered an important tool in DFs diagnosis, as it improves diagnostic accuracy for clinically amelanotic nodules. Although typical dermoscopic patterns are most frequently seen in clinical practice, there have also been some atypical variants described, mimicking some underlying recurrent and sometimes harmful skin afflictions. Usually, no treatment is required, although an appropriate work-up may be necessary in specific cases, such as in the presence of atypical variants or a history of recent changes. This narrative review’s aim is to summarize current evidence regarding clinical presentation, positive and differential diagnosis of atypical dermatofibromas and also to raise awareness about the importance of specific characteristics of atypical variants to better differentiate them from malignant conditions.

Results,"This narrative review aimed to reevaluate the clinical and land dermoscopic patterns of atypical dermatofibromas compared to the typical ones. Although the clinical diagnosis of DFs may be simple in daily practice, in the presence of various patterns, diagnosis of DFs can become challenging. Therefore, specific characterization of these atypical variants is essential in differentiating them from malignant conditions and assessing the risk of local recurrence."

Moreover, there have been mentioned some not-so-common etiopathogenic factors. Dermatofibromas are prevalent cutaneous benign tumours that most frequently affect young or middle-aged adults. Clinically, dermatofibromas appear as single or multiple firm papules or nodules with a smooth surface anywhere on the body, mainly on the lower extremities. They can vary in size and colour from light brown to dark brown, yellow, purple or red. Although the clinical diagnosis of DFs may be simple in daily practice, in the presence of various patterns, diagnosis of DFs can become challenging. Therefore, it is essential to consider the possible links between dermoscopy and histology and complete surgical excision, especially in the presence of atypical variants or a history of recent changes. Thus, the precise definition of dermoscopic patterns for this frequent benign tumour is of major interest."

Conclusions,"Clinical diagnosis of typical dermatofibromas is easy, with a classic dermoscopic pattern of pigmented network and central white patch. However, in current clinical situations, dermatofibromas display a wide range of presentations and histological variants that make the differentiation from other tumours, such as malignant melanoma, very difficult. Specific characterization of these atypical variants is essential in differentiating them from possibly more aggressive lesions and assessing the risk of local recurrence. As a matter of fact, the definitive diagnosis of a skin condition, especially in a doubtful clinical diagnostic scenario, demands complete surgical resection and histopathological analysis. As artificial intelligence technologies had reached an impressive precision in identifying various skin lesions, along with other inovative diagnostic methods, we can emphasise that in the future it will lead to improved safety and patient care and maybe enhance dermatologists’ productivity."

Types of prescription lenses include: * **Eyeglasses.** Wearing glasses is a simple, safe way to sharpen vision caused by nearsightedness. Eyeglass lenses also can be designed to correct a combination of refractive errors, such as nearsightedness, astigmatism and presbyopia. * **Contact lenses.** Contact lenses are small, plastic disks placed directly on the cornea. A single contact lens may correct more than one refractive error. There are a variety of materials and care requirements. Your eye care specialist can recommend contact lenses that are most suitable for your prescription and lifestyle."

Your eye surgeon uses a laser to reshape the cornea, which results in a decreased need for nearsighted prescription lenses. Even after surgery, you may need to use eyeglasses some of the time. * **Laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis (LASIK).** With this procedure, your eye surgeon makes a thin, hinged flap in your cornea. The surgeon then uses a laser to remove corneal tissue to flatten its domed shape. Recovery from LASIK surgery is usually more rapid and causes less discomfort than recovery from other corneal surgeries. * **Laser-assisted subepithelial keratectomy (LASEK).** The surgeon creates an ultrathin flap only in the cornea's outer protective cover, called the epithelium. A laser is used to reshape the cornea and flatten its curve. The epithelium is then put back in place. * **Photorefractive keratectomy (PRK).** This procedure is similar to LASEK, except the surgeon completely removes the epithelium. Then the surgeon uses the laser to reshape the cornea. A temporary protective contact lens covers the cornea until the epithelium grows back naturally, conforming to your cornea's new shape. * **Small incision lenticule extraction (SMILE).** In this procedure, there is no flap or removal of the epithelium. Instead, a laser is used to cut a small disk-shaped piece of the cornea, called a lenticule. The lenticule is then removed through a small corneal incision. Surgical treatments are not an option for everyone with nearsightedness. Surgery is recommended only when nearsightedness is no longer progressing. Your surgeon explains the benefits and risks of surgical treatment options."

Ophthalmologists are trained to provide complete eye evaluations, prescribe corrective lenses, diagnose and treat common and complex eye disorders, and perform eye surgery. * **Optometrist.** An optometrist has a doctor of optometry (O.D.) degree. Optometrists are trained to provide complete eye evaluations, prescribe corrective lenses, and diagnose and treat common eye disorders. * **Optician.** An optician is a specialist who helps fit people for eyeglasses or contact lenses following prescriptions from ophthalmologists and optometrists. Some states require opticians to be licensed. Opticians are not trained to diagnose or treat eye disease."

If you wear contacts, bring an empty contact lens box for each eye to your appointment. * **List any symptoms you're experiencing,** such as trouble reading up close or difficulty with night driving. * **Make a list of all medicines, vitamins or supplements** that you're taking. * **Create a list of questions to ask** your eye care specialist. Preparing a list of questions can help you make the most of your visit. For nearsightedness, some basic questions to ask include: * When do I need to use corrective lenses? * What are benefits and drawbacks to glasses? * What are benefits and drawbacks to contacts? * How often do you recommend that I have my eyes examined? * Are more-permanent treatments, such as eye surgery, an option for me? * If so, which do you recommend? * What types of side effects are possible from these treatments? * Will my insurance company pay for surgical procedures or a contact lens fitting? * Do you have any brochures or other printed material that I can take home with me? What websites do you recommend?"

Melanocytic nevi,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482430/,"[Bookshelf](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/ ""Bookshelf home"")",Etiology,"The respiratory centers in the pons and medulla control alveolar ventilation. Chemoreceptors for PCO2, PO2, and pH regulate ventilation. Central chemoreceptors in the medulla are sensitive to changes in the pH level. A decreased pH level influences the mechanics of ventilation and maintains proper levels of carbon dioxide and oxygen. When ventilation is disrupted, arterial PCO2 increases and an acid-base disorder develop. Another pathophysiological mechanism may be due to ventilation/perfusion mismatch of dead space. Respiratory acidosis can be subcategorized as acute, chronic, or acute and chronic. In acute respiratory acidosis, there is a sudden elevation of PCO2 because of failure of ventilation. This may be due to cerebrovascular accidents, use of central nervous system (CNS) depressants such as opioids, or inability to use muscles of respiration because of disorders like myasthenia gravis, muscular dystrophy or Guillain-Barre Syndrome. Because of its acute nature, there is a slight compensation occurring minutes after the incidence. On the contrary, chronic respiratory acidosis may be caused by COPD where there is a decreased responsiveness of the reflexes to states of hypoxia and hypercapnia. Other individuals who develop chronic respiratory acidosis may have fatigue of the diaphragm resulting from a muscular disorder. Chronic respiratory acidosis can also be seen in obesity hypoventilation syndrome, also known as Pickwickian syndrome, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and in patients with severe thoracic skeletal defects. In patients with chronic compensated respiratory disease and acidosis, an acute insult such as pneumonia or disease exacerbation can lead to ventilation/perfusion mismatch."

The pH is the primary stimulus to initiate ventilation. In its normal state, the body maintains CO2 in a well-controlled range from 38 to 42 mm Hg by balancing its production and elimination. In a state of hypoventilation, the body produces more CO2 than it can eliminate, causing a net retention of CO2. The increased CO2 is what leads to an increase in hydrogen ions and a slight increase in bicarbonate, as seen by a right shift in the following equilibrium reaction of carbon dioxide: * CO2 + H2O -> H2CO3- -> HCO3- + H+"

All healthcare workers including the nurse practitioners must be familiar with the management of respiratory acidosis. Once the diagnosis has been made, the underlying cause of respiratory acidosis has to be treated. The hypercapnia should be corrected gradually because rapid alkalization of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) may lead to seizures. Pharmacologic therapy can also be used to help improve ventilation. Bronchodilators like beta-agonists, anticholinergic drugs, and methylxanthines can be used in treating patients with obstructive airway diseases. Naloxone can be used in patients who overdose on opioids. Patients who are moribund, lethargic, or confused need to be monitored in the intensive care unit (ICU). Those who exhibit hypoventilation will need endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. The use of CNS stimulants has not been shown to improve the condition and thus empirical prescription of these drugs should be avoided."

Melanoma,https://www.iarc.who.int/cancer-type/skin-cancer/,Skin cancer,Introduction,"Summary Skin cancers are the most common groups of cancers diagnosed worldwide, with more than 1.5 million new cases estimated in 2022. In 2022, an estimated 330 000 new cases of melanoma were diagnosed worldwide and almost 60 000 people died from the disease. There are large geographical variations in melanoma incidence rates across countries and world regions. In most world regions, melanoma occurs more frequently in men than in women."

Melanocytes are cells that make the pigment that gives skin its color. The pigment is called melanin. This illustration shows melanoma cells extending from the surface of the skin into the deeper skin layers. Melanoma is a kind of skin cancer that starts in the melanocytes. Melanocytes are cells that make the pigment that gives skin its color. The pigment is called melanin. Melanoma typically starts on skin that's often exposed to the sun. This includes the skin on the arms, back, face and legs. Melanoma also can form in the eyes. Rarely, it can happen inside the body, such as in the nose or throat. The exact cause of all melanomas isn't clear. Most melanomas are caused by exposure to ultraviolet light. Ultraviolet light, also called UV light, comes from sunlight or tanning lamps and beds. Limiting exposure to UV light can help reduce the risk of melanoma. The risk of melanoma seems to be increasing in people under 40, especially women. Knowing the symptoms of skin cancer can help ensure that cancerous changes are detected and treated before the cancer has spread. Melanoma can be treated successfully if it is found early."

This melanoma shows color variations and an irregular border, both of which are melanoma warning signs. The first melanoma signs and symptoms often are: * A change in an existing mole. * The development of a new pigmented or unusual-looking growth on the skin. Melanoma doesn't always begin as a mole. It also can happen on otherwise healthy skin. Melanomas symptoms can happen anywhere on the body. Melanomas most often develop in areas that have had exposure to the sun. This includes the arms, back, face and legs. Melanomas also can happen in areas that aren't as exposed to the sun. This includes the soles of the feet, palms of the hands and fingernail beds. Melanoma also can happen inside the body. These hidden melanomas are more common in people with brown or Black skin."

They may have certain characteristics that indicate melanomas or other skin cancers. Characteristics may include: * **Asymmetrical shape.** Look for moles with unusual shapes, such as two very different-looking halves. * **Changes in color.** Look for growths that have many colors or unusual color patterns. * **Changes in size.** Look for new growth in a mole larger than 1/4 inch (about 6 millimeters). * **Changes in symptoms.** Look for changes in symptoms, such as new itchiness or bleeding. * **Unusual border.** Look for moles with unusual, notched or scalloped borders. Moles that become cancers can all look very different. Some may show all of the changes listed above, while others may have only one or two unusual characteristics."

These areas may include the spaces between the toes and on the palms, soles, scalp or genitals. These are sometimes referred to as hidden melanomas because they occur in places most people wouldn't think to check. When melanoma occurs in people with brown or Black skin, it's more likely to occur in a hidden area. Hidden melanomas include: * **Melanoma inside the body.** Mucosal melanoma develops in the mucous membrane. This tissue lines the nose, mouth, esophagus, anus, urinary tract and vagina. Mucosal melanomas are especially difficult to detect because they can easily be mistaken for other far more common conditions. * **Melanoma in the eye.** Eye melanoma also is called ocular melanoma. It most often occurs in the layer of tissue beneath the white of the eye. This layer is called the uvea. An eye melanoma may cause vision changes and may be diagnosed during an eye exam. * **Melanoma under a nail.** Acral-lentiginous melanoma is a rare form of melanoma that can occur under a fingernail or toenail. It also can be found on the palms of the hands or the soles of the feet. Acral-lentiginous melanoma tends to be very dark, flat and have very unusual borders. It's more common in people of Asian descent and people with brown or Black skin."

One type of skin cancer called basal cell carcinoma begins in the basal cells. Basal cells make skin cells that keep pushing older cells toward the surface. As new cells move up, they become squamous cells. Skin cancer that starts in the squamous cells is called squamous cell carcinoma of the skin. Melanoma, another type of skin cancer, happens in the pigment cells, called melanocytes. Melanoma happens when something changes healthy melanocytes into cancer cells. Melanocytes are skin cells that make pigment that gives skin its color. The pigment is called melanin. Melanoma starts when melanocytes develop changes in their DNA. A cell's DNA holds the instructions that tell a cell what to do. In healthy cells, DNA gives instructions to grow and multiply at a set rate. The instructions tell the cells to die at a set time. In cancer cells, the DNA changes give different instructions. The changes tell the cancer cells to make many more cells quickly. Cancer cells can keep living when healthy cells would die. This causes too many cells. The cancer cells might form a mass called a tumor. The tumor can grow to invade and destroy healthy body tissue. In time, cancer cells can break away and spread to other parts of the body. When cancer spreads, it's called metastatic cancer. It isn't clear what changes the DNA in skin cells and how it leads to melanoma. It's likely a combination of factors, including environmental and genetic factors. Still, healthcare professionals believe exposure to ultraviolet light is the leading cause of melanoma. Ultraviolet light, also called UV light, comes from the sun and from tanning lamps and beds. UV light doesn't cause all melanomas, especially those that occur in places on your body that don't receive exposure to sunlight. This means that other factors may contribute to your risk of melanoma."
Melanoma,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/melanoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20374884,[Melanoma](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/melanoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20374884),Risk factors,"Factors that may increase the risk of melanoma include: * **A family history of melanoma.** If a close relative has had melanoma, you have a greater chance of developing a melanoma, too. Close relatives may include a parent, child or sibling. * **A history of sunburn.** One or more severe, blistering sunburns can increase your risk of melanoma. * **Exposure to UV light.** The ultraviolet light, also called UV light, that comes from the sun and from tanning lights and beds increases the risk of skin cancer, including melanoma. * **Having many moles or moles that aren't typical.** Having more than 50 typical moles on your body indicates an increased risk of melanoma. Also, having a type of mole that isn't typical increases the risk of melanoma. Known medically as dysplastic nevi, these moles tend to be larger than typical moles. They may have unusual borders and a mixture of colors. * **Living closer to the equator or at a higher elevation.** People living closer to the earth's equator experience more direct sun rays. Therefore, they experience higher amounts of UV light from the sun than people living farther north or south. Also, people who live at a higher elevation are more exposed to UV light. * **Skin that sunburns easily.** Anyone can get melanoma, but it's most common in people with white skin. If you have blond or red hair, light-colored eyes, and freckle or sunburn easily, you're more likely to develop melanoma. * **Weakened immune system.** If the body's germ-fighting immune system is weakened by medications or illness, there might be a higher risk of melanoma and other skin cancers. People with a weakened immune system include those taking medicines to control the immune system, such as after an organ transplant. Certain medical conditions, such as infection with HIV, can weaken the immune system."

Exposure to this kind of light can increase your risk of skin cancer. * **Avoid the sun during the middle of the day.** For many people in North America, the sun's rays are strongest between about 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. Schedule outdoor activities for other times of the day, even in winter or when the sky is cloudy. * **Become familiar with your skin so that you'll notice changes.** Check your skin often for new skin growths. Look for changes in existing moles, freckles, bumps and birthmarks. With the help of mirrors, check your face, neck, ears and scalp. Look at your chest and trunk and the tops and undersides of your arms and hands. Check both the front and back of your legs and your feet, including the soles and the spaces between your toes. Also check your genital area and between your buttocks. * **Wear protective clothing.** When you go outside during the day, wear clothes that help protect your skin from the sun's rays. Cover your skin with dark, tightly woven clothing that covers your arms and legs. Wear a broad-brimmed hat, which provides more protection than does a baseball cap or visor. Some companies also sell protective clothing. A dermatologist can recommend an appropriate brand. Don't forget sunglasses. Look for those that block both types of UV light that come from the sun, called UVA and UVB. * **Wear sunscreen year-round.** Use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30, even on cloudy days. Apply sunscreen generously. Reapply every two hours, or more often if you're swimming or sweating. Dec. 30, 2023"

A total of nine different enzymes activate each other in a kind of chain reaction: One enzyme in the first stage alerts several enzymes in a second stage, each of which activates several enzymes in a third stage, and so on. This allows the immune response to grow stronger very quickly. The tasks of these enzymes include: * marking germs as targets for phagocytes, * attracting other immune system cells from the bloodstream, * fighting viruses by destroying the viral envelope (the outermost layer of a virus) or cells that have been infected with viruses."
Melanoma,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK279396/,"[Bookshelf](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/ ""Bookshelf home"")",T cells,"T cells have three main jobs: * They use chemical messengers to activate other cells of the immune system, starting the adaptive immune system response (T helper cells). * They detect tumor cells or cells that have been infected by viruses and destroy them (cytotoxic T cells). * Some T helper cells become memory T cells after the infection has cleared up. They ""remember"" the germ that was fought off, and are then ready to activate the adaptive immune system quickly if the body is infected by the same germ again. T cells have specific features (receptors) on their surfaces that germs can attach to – like a lock that one particular key will fit. The immune system can make a matching T cell type for each germ within a few days of infection. Then if a germ attaches to a matching T cell, the T cell starts to multiply – making more T cells that can specifically fight that germ. Because only the cells that match the germ multiply, the immune response is “tailor-made.”"
Melanoma,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK279396/,"[Bookshelf](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/ ""Bookshelf home"")",B cells,"B cells (B lymphocytes) are made in the bone marrow, where they mature into specialized immune system cells. They take their name from the ""B"" in ""bone marrow."" Like the T cells, there are many different types of B cells that match particular germs. B cells are activated by T helper cells: T helper cells send signals to B cells that match the same germs as they do. This stimulates the B cells to make copies of themselves and turn into plasma cells. The plasma cells quickly make very large amounts of antibodies and release them into the blood. Because the T helper cells only activate the B cells that match the attacking germs, the body only makes the exact antibodies that are needed. Some of the activated B cells turn into memory cells and become part of the ""memory"" of the adaptive immune system. The different cells of the adaptive immune system communicate either directly or through soluble chemical messengers such as cytokines (usually proteins). These chemical messengers are made by various cells in the body."

They are made by the immune system to fight germs and foreign substances. Antibodies can quickly recognize germs and other potentially harmful substances, and then attach to them. This makes the ""intruders"" harmless and attracts other immune system cells to help. Antibodies are made by B cells. Germs and substances that can trigger the production of antibodies are called ""antigens."" An antibody only attaches to an antigen if it matches exactly, like a key in the lock of the antibody. In this way, antibodies recognize matching germs and trigger the fast response of the adaptive immune system. Antibodies have three main functions: * They activate other immune system cells by attaching to their surface. Also, it’s much easier for phagocytes to fight off germs that have a lot of antibodies attached to them. * They activate proteins that help in the immune system response. So the antibodies of the adaptive immune system also help the innate immune system to do its job."

Benign keratosis-like lesions,https://challenge.isic-archive.com/landing/2019/,[![ISIC Challenge](https://challenge.isic-archive.com/static/img/isic_logo.svg)](https://challenge.isic-archive.com/),Rationale,"Clinical application on skin lesion classification has two goals eventually: Giving specific information and treatment options for a lesion, and detecting skin cancer with a reasonable sensitivity and specificity. The first task needs a correct specific diagnosis out of multiple classes, whereas the second demands a binary decision ""biopsy"" versus ""don’t biopsy"". In the former ISIC Challenges, focus was on the second task, therefore this year we want to rank for the more ambitious metric of normalized multiclass accuracy, as it is also closer to real evaluation of a dermatologist. This is also important for the extending reader study, where the winning algorithm(s) will be compared to physicians performance in classification of digital images."

Benign keratosis-like lesions,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK431055/,"[Bookshelf](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/ ""Bookshelf home"")",Overview of Normal Menstrual Physiology,"The menstrual cycle is orchestrated by the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian (HPO) axis. The cycle begins in the hypothalamus with the pulsatile secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). A specific pulsatile pattern of GnRH stimulates the anterior pituitary gland to secrete follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). The FSH then stimulates the development of a cohort of follicles within the ovaries. Each developing follicle grows to contain several layers of stromal cells surrounding a single oocyte. Under the stimulation of FSH, these follicles mature, and the stromal cells begin secreting estrogen. Estrogen stimulates the endometrium (ie, the inner lining of the uterus) to grow and thicken. Estrogen also provides feedback inhibition at the pituitary level, reducing FSH secretion. As the FSH levels decline, most developing follicles undergo atresia, leaving (usually) a single dominant follicle that can increase its number of FSH receptors, allowing it alone to continue its maturation process. As this dominant follicle nears the time of ovulation, estrogen (briefly and for poorly understood reasons) develops a stimulatory effect on the pituitary gland, resulting in a surge of luteinizing hormone (LH) from the anterior pituitary. This LH surge triggers ovulation in which the oocyte is released from the follicle, and the now-empty follicle transforms into a structure called the corpus luteum. In the cycle's luteal phase, the corpus luteum secretes progesterone, which causes maturation and stabilization of the endometrium. Progesterone, the ""pro-gestational hormone,"" is necessary for maintaining the endometrium throughout gestation. Without fertilization, the corpus luteum undergoes involution approximately 2 weeks after ovulation. Involution results in a rapid decline in progesterone and estrogen levels, and this hormonal withdrawal leads to endometrial shedding. The menstrual fluid then flows out of the uterus through the cervix and vagina. Low levels of gonadal hormones (ie, estrogen and progesterone) release the hypothalamus and pituitary from feedback inhibition and allow the GnRH pulse to restart, triggering a new cycle."

If the hypothalamus does not release GnRH or the pituitary gland does not release FSH or LH, the ovaries will not be stimulated to develop follicles. If follicles do not develop, the gonadal hormones estrogen and progesterone will not be produced in significant quantities. Therefore, the endometrium will not receive the hormonal stimulation required to grow and shed, resulting in amenorrhea. Numerous potential causes of hypothalamic and pituitary dysfunction can result in secondary amenorrhea, including: * **Prolactinomas** : Prolactinomas are a type of pituitary adenoma that secrete prolactin, suppressing gonadotropin release. * **Infarction/necrosis (Sheehan syndrome)** : The pituitary gland can infarct during episodes of acute hypovolemia, eg, a severe postpartum hemorrhage, leading to a nonfunctional pituitary gland. * **Infectious** : Some intracranial infections, including tuberculosis, encephalitis/meningitis, and syphilis, may result in hypothalamic or pituitary dysfunction. * **Infiltrative disease** : Conditions, eg, cancer, sarcoidosis, and hemochromatosis can lead to dysfunction or destruction of hormonally active tissue. * **Inherited etiologies (Kallman syndrome)** : Several genetic mutations have been identified that result in deficiencies of olfactory and GnRH-producing neurons, leading to a clinical syndrome characterized by hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and anosmia."

With prolonged use, the endometrium may become chronically suppressed, resulting in a lack of bleeding even during a scheduled hormone-free interval. * **Intrauterine adhesions (Asherman syndrome)** : If the basal layer of the endometrium is destroyed, deep scarring develops, and the endometrium cannot proliferate despite normal hormone profiles, resulting in secondary amenorrhea. Intrauterine adhesions may be caused by vigorous curettage, often in the setting of an intrauterine infection, after a miscarriage, therapeutic abortion, or postpartum hemorrhage. Additionally, tuberculous endometritis, seen primarily in developing regions of the world, can lead to extensive intrauterine adhesions and secondary amenorrhea. Except for natural menopause, almost all of the etiologies of amenorrhea, including physiologic, hypothalamic, pituitary, hormonal/endocrine, and ovarian causes, can present as either primary or secondary amenorrhea.

The following findings may help identify the underlying etiology: * **Negative test results** : If no withdrawal bleed occurs, this can indicate any of the following: * Endogenous estrogen is insufficient to stimulate the growth of the endometrium (eg, POI, hypothalamic or pituitary dysfunction) * The endometrium has been damaged and is unable to grow (eg, Asherman syndrome) * The outflow of menstrual blood has been obstructed (eg, cervical stenosis) An estrogen-progestin challenge can be performed to test whether or not sufficient endogenous estrogen is present. The patient is typically given a 3-week course of both estrogen and progestin (usually given in the form of combined oral contraceptive pills) and then observed for evidence of a withdrawal bleed. If the patient bleeds with the added estrogen, this suggests insufficient endogenous estrogen present to grow the endometrium. If there is no withdrawal bleeding, the endometrium is damaged (eg, Asherman syndrome), or the outflow tract is obstructed.

However, they also affect females and younger adults * Fair skin, blue eyes and blond or red hair — note; BCC can also affect darker skin types"
Basal cell carcinoma,https://dermnetnz.org/topics/basal-cell-carcinoma,**Basal cell carcinoma**,What causes basal cell carcinoma?,"The cause of BCC is multifactorial. * Most often, there are DNA mutations in the patched (PTCH) tumour suppressor gene, part of hedgehog signalling pathway. * These may be triggered by exposure to ultraviolet radiation."
Basal cell carcinoma,https://dermnetnz.org/topics/basal-cell-carcinoma,**Basal cell carcinoma**,What are the clinical features of basal cell carcinoma?,"BCC is a locally invasive skin tumour. The main characteristics are: * Slowly growing plaque or nodule * Skin coloured, pink or pigmented * Varies in size from a few millimetres to several centimetres in diameter * Spontaneous bleeding or ulceration. BCC is very rarely a threat to life. A tiny proportion of BCCs grow rapidly, invade deeply, and/or metastasise to local lymph nodes."

Basal cell carcinoma,https://dermnetnz.org/topics/basal-cell-carcinoma,**Basal cell carcinoma**,How is basal cell carcinoma diagnosed?,Some typical superficial BCCs on trunk and limbs are clinically diagnosed and have non-surgical treatment without histology.
Basal cell carcinoma,https://dermnetnz.org/topics/basal-cell-carcinoma,**Basal cell carcinoma**,What is the treatment for primary basal cell carcinoma?,"The treatment for a BCC depends on its type, size and location, the number to be treated, patient factors, and the preference or expertise of the doctor. Most BCCs are treated surgically. Long-term follow-up is recommended to check for new lesions and recurrence; the latter may be unnecessary if histology has reported wide clear margins."
Basal cell carcinoma,https://dermnetnz.org/topics/basal-cell-carcinoma,**Basal cell carcinoma**,Excision biopsy,"* Most appropriate treatment for nodular, infiltrative and morphoeic BCCs. * Should include 3 to 5 mm margin of normal skin around the tumour. * Pathologist will report deep and lateral margins. * Further surgery is recommended for lesions that are incompletely excised."

Basal cell carcinoma,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/basal-cell-carcinoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20354187,Basal cell carcinoma,Overview,"Basal cell carcinoma is a type of skin cancer. Basal cell carcinoma begins in the basal cells — a type of cell within the skin that produces new skin cells as old ones die off. Basal cell carcinoma often appears as a slightly transparent bump on the skin, though it can take other forms. Basal cell carcinoma occurs most often on areas of the skin that are exposed to the sun, such as your head and neck. Most basal cell carcinomas are thought to be caused by long-term exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from sunlight. Avoiding the sun and using sunscreen may help protect against basal cell carcinoma."
Basal cell carcinoma,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/basal-cell-carcinoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20354187,Basal cell carcinoma,Basal cell carcinoma on white skin,"Basal cell carcinoma is a type of skin cancer that most often develops on areas of skin exposed to the sun, such as the face. On white skin, basal cell carcinoma often looks like a bump that's skin-colored or pink."
Basal cell carcinoma,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/basal-cell-carcinoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20354187,Basal cell carcinoma,Basal cell carcinoma on brown skin,"Basal cell carcinoma is a type of skin cancer that most often develops on areas of skin exposed to the sun, such as the face. On brown and Black skin, basal cell carcinoma often looks like a bump that's brown or glossy black and has a rolled border."
Basal cell carcinoma,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/basal-cell-carcinoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20354187,Basal cell carcinoma,Symptoms,"Basal cell carcinoma usually develops on sun-exposed parts of your body, especially your head and neck. Less often, basal cell carcinoma can develop on parts of your body usually protected from the sun, such as the genitals. Basal cell carcinoma appears as a change in the skin, such as a growth or a sore that won't heal. These changes in the skin (lesions) usually have one of the following characteristics: * **A shiny, skin-colored bump** that's translucent, meaning you can see a bit through the surface. The bump can look pearly white or pink on white skin. On brown and Black skin, the bump often looks brown or glossy black. Tiny blood vessels might be visible, though they may be difficult to see on brown and Black skin. The bump may bleed and scab over. * **A brown, black or blue lesion** — or a lesion with dark spots — with a slightly raised, translucent border. * **A flat, scaly patch** with a raised edge. Over time, these patches can grow quite large. * **A white, waxy, scar-like lesion** without a clearly defined border."

Basal cell carcinoma,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/basal-cell-carcinoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20354187,Basal cell carcinoma,Causes,"Basal cell carcinoma occurs when one of the skin's basal cells develops a mutation in its DNA. Basal cells are found at the bottom of the epidermis — the outermost layer of skin. Basal cells produce new skin cells. As new skin cells are produced, they push older cells toward the skin's surface, where the old cells die and are sloughed off."
Basal cell carcinoma,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/basal-cell-carcinoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20354187,Basal cell carcinoma,Where skin cancer develops,"Skin cancer begins in the cells that make up the outer layer (epidermis) of your skin. One type of skin cancer called basal cell carcinoma begins in the basal cells, which make skin cells that continuously push older cells toward the surface. As new cells move upward, they become flattened squamous cells, where a skin cancer called squamous cell carcinoma can occur. Melanoma, another type of skin cancer, arises in the pigment cells (melanocytes). The process of creating new skin cells is controlled by a basal cell's DNA. The DNA contains the instructions that tell a cell what to do. The mutation tells the basal cell to multiply rapidly and continue growing when it would normally die. Eventually the accumulating abnormal cells may form a cancerous tumor — the lesion that appears on the skin."
Basal cell carcinoma,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/basal-cell-carcinoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20354187,Basal cell carcinoma,Ultraviolet light and other causes,"Much of the damage to DNA in basal cells is thought to result from ultraviolet (UV) radiation found in sunlight and in commercial tanning lamps and tanning beds. But sun exposure doesn't explain skin cancers that develop on skin not ordinarily exposed to sunlight. Other factors can contribute to the risk and development of basal cell carcinoma, and the exact cause may in some cases not be clear."
Basal cell carcinoma,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/basal-cell-carcinoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20354187,Basal cell carcinoma,Complications,"Complications of basal cell carcinoma can include: * **A risk of recurrence.** Basal cell carcinomas commonly recur, even after successful treatment. * **An increased risk of other types of skin cancer.** A history of basal cell carcinoma may also increase the chance of developing other types of skin cancer, such as squamous cell carcinoma. * **Cancer that spreads beyond the skin.** Very rarely, basal cell carcinoma can spread (metastasize) to nearby lymph nodes and other areas of the body, such as the bones and lungs."

Basal cell carcinoma,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK538173/,"[Bookshelf](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/ ""Bookshelf home"")",Continuing Education Activity,"Back pain is one of the most common causes for which patients seek emergency care. This symptom tends to be persistent, causing some individuals significant disability. People of any age can present with back pain arising from mechanical or nonspecific causes. Etiologies differ for each age group, which can guide the clinician in determining the appropriate treatment. This activity explores the multifaceted back pain landscape. The material presented here equips healthcare professionals to identify and differentiate the symptom's various sources, recognize red flags for severe conditions, and formulate an interprofessional approach to diagnosis and treatment. Participants will gain insights into the evidence-based conservative management of nonspecific back pain, which relies more on maintaining physical activity and less on pharmacological interventions. This CME activity provides essential competence for providers to enhance patient care and outcomes and reduce back pain's negative impact on patients' quality of life, productivity, and healthcare costs."

Eliminating the cause of this symptom profoundly improves patients' functional capacity and quality of life.
Basal cell carcinoma,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK538173/,"[Bookshelf](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/ ""Bookshelf home"")",Etiology,"* **Traumatic:** Back pain commonly results from direct or indirect contact with an external force. Examples are whiplash injury, strain, and traumatic fractures. * **Degenerative:** Musculoskeletal structures can weaken over time due to aging, overuse, or pre-existing pathology. Conditions like intervertebral disk herniation and degenerative disk disease fall into this class. * **Oncologic:** Anatomic structures of the back can develop primary or secondary malignant lesions. Pathologic fractures of the axial skeleton can arise as a complication. * **Infectious:** Infections of the musculoskeletal structures in this region can arise from direct inoculation or spread from another source. * **Inflammatory:** This category includes inflammatory conditions not caused by infection or malignancy. Examples are ankylosing spondylitis and sacroiliitis. Chronic inflammation can give rise to spinal arthritis. * **Metabolic:** Calcium and bone metabolism can cause the symptoms. Osteoporosis and osteosclerosis are examples. * **Referred pain:** Visceral organ inflammation can cause referred back pain. Examples are biliary colic, lung disease, and aortic or vertebral artery pathology. * **Postural:** Spending long hours in an upright position can cause back pain. Pregnancy and certain occupations can predispose people to postural back pain. * **Congenital:** Inborn conditions of the axial skeleton can cause the symptoms. Examples are kyphoscoliosis and tethered spinal cord. * **Psychiatric:** Back pain may also present in patients with chronic pain syndromes and other mental health conditions. Malingering individuals may also claim to have back pain. The problem's duration must also be considered, as acute back pain often has different sources from chronic back pain. Thorough clinical evaluation and appropriate diagnostic examination are usually enough to determine the exact cause of this symptom. Depending on the findings, referral to specialists such as orthopedic surgeons, neurologists, rheumatologists, or pain management specialists may be necessary for further evaluation and treatment planning."
Basal cell carcinoma,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK538173/,"[Bookshelf](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/ ""Bookshelf home"")",Treatment / Management,"Adult and pediatric back pain require different management approaches. Many cases have an unidentifiable cause, although degenerative disease and musculoskeletal injury are more common in adults than children. By comparison, overuse and muscle strain typically precipitate back pain in children and adolescents. Rare causes like malignancy and metabolic conditions also present differently in various age groups. Therefore, treatments must be appropriate for both the condition and the patient's age."
Basal cell carcinoma,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK538173/,"[Bookshelf](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/ ""Bookshelf home"")",Management of Back Pain in Adults,"* Early return to normal routines, except for heavy labor * Avoidance of activities that precipitate the pain * Patient education Second-line options that may be offered to the patient include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), muscle relaxants, opioids, spinal manipulation, physical therapy, superficial heat application, and alternative treatments like acupuncture and massage. Education about the possible causes of back pain must be tailored to each patient's circumstances. Patient education is crucial in preventing back pain aggravation or recurrence. The patient may be advised to follow up after 2 weeks. Resumption of normal routines must be recommended if asymptomatic during follow-up. For adult patients with acute radicular back pain, NSAID intake, exercise, traction, and spinal manipulation may be advised. Diazepam and systemic steroids have no added benefit. Diagnostics tests are necessary if serious conditions cannot be ruled out. Referral to other specialists for other tests and treatments must be considered."

Differential Diagnosis of Back Pain in Adults * Lumbosacral muscle strains and sprains: Usually from a traumatic incident or repetitive overuse; pain worsens with movement and gets better with rest; range of motion is restricted; muscles are tender to palpation * Lumbar spondylosis: The patient is typically older than 40 years; hip pain may be present; pain occurs with lower limb extension or rotation; neurologic exam is usually normal * Disk herniation: Usually involves the L4 to S1 segments; may have associated paresthesia, sensory change, loss of strength or reflexes, depending on the severity and nerve root involved * Vertebral compression fracture: Localized back pain worsening with flexion; point tenderness on palpation; may be acute or chronic; steroid use, vitamin D deficiency, and osteoporosis are risk factors * Spinal stenosis: Accompanied by leg sensory and motor weakness relieved with rest (neurologic claudication); neurologic exam may be normal initially but progress with increasing stenosis * Fracture: May arise from trauma, prolonged corticosteroid use, and osteoporosis; common among patients older than 70 years; associated findings include contusions, abrasions, tenderness to palpation over spinous processes Differential Diagnosis of Back Pain in Children and Adolescents * Disk herniation and slipped apophysis: May present with acute back pain, radicular pain, and recent-onset scoliosis; physical findings include positive SLR test and pain on spinal forward flexion. * Spondylolysis, spondylolisthesis, and posterior arch lesion: Acute-onset back pain presents with radicular pain; hamstring tightness may be present; physical findings include positive SLR test and pain on spinal extension. * Vertebral fracture: Trauma is the most common cause; acute back pain may be associated with other injuries; neurologic deficits may be present on physical examination; stress fractures may present insidiously and produce progressive postural changes. * Muscle strain: Acute back pain is typically associated with muscle tenderness without radiation.Scheuermann’s kyphosis: Back pain is chronic and associated with rigid kyphosis. * Inflammatory spondyloarthropathies: Pertinent findings on history include chronic pain, morning stiffness lasting greater than 30 minutes, and sacroiliac joint tenderness."

For example, individuals with jobs that do not require hard physical labor must be reminded to stay active to maintain a healthy body weight. A BMI greater than 25 correlates with worse outcomes. The same reminder must be given to people with labor-intensive occupations. However, these individuals should also avoid factors precipitating back pain, such as heavy-load lifting and excessive or repeated back-twisting. These patients should lighten their loads or use lifting equipment when moving weighty objects. The vast majority of back pain cases are self-limited. However, all discharged patients advised to follow up should be instructed to seek medical attention immediately for concerning signs like sudden sensory and motor weakness."

Basal cell carcinoma,https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000885.htm,Warts,Treatment,"Expand Section Your provider can treat a wart if you do not like how it looks or if it is painful. Do not attempt to remove a wart yourself by burning, cutting, tearing, picking, or by any other method. MEDICINES Over-the-counter medicines are available to remove warts. Ask your provider which treatment is right for you. Do not use over-the-counter wart medicines on your face or genitals. Warts in these areas need to be treated by your provider. To use wart-removal medicine: * File the wart with a nail file or emery board when your skin is damp (for example, after a shower or bath). This helps remove dead tissue. Do not use the same emery board on your nails. * Put the medicine on the wart every day for several weeks or months. Follow the instructions on the label. * Cover the wart with a bandage. OTHER TREATMENTS Special foot cushions can help ease the pain from plantar warts. You can buy these at drugstores without a prescription. Use socks. Wear shoes with plenty of room. Avoid high heels. Your provider may need to trim away thick skin or calluses that form over warts on your foot or around nails. Your provider may recommend the following treatments if your warts do not go away: * Stronger (prescription) medicines * A blistering solution * Laser treatment for difficult-to-remove warts * Immunotherapy, which gives you a shot of a substance that causes an allergic reaction and helps the wart go away * Imiquimod, which is applied to warts"

Albuterol is a commonly prescribed bronchodilator used for managing diverse respiratory conditions, including asthma and exercise-induced bronchospasm. This activity covers the appropriate indications, administration, contraindications, adverse drug reactions, and precautions associated with albuterol to ensure its safe and proper utilization.

Pyogenic granulomas and hemorrhage,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482272/,"[Bookshelf](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/ ""Bookshelf home"")",Pharmacokinetics,"Absorption: Albuterol directly affects the bronchial smooth muscle upon inhalation without initially entering the bloodstream. Trace amounts appear in the blood approximately 2 to 3 hours after inhalation. Notably, albuterol levels in the body remain low when taken at recommended inhalation doses. In a study involving 12 healthy participants, a higher albuterol dosage (1080 mcg of albuterol base) led to peak concentrations of around 3 ng/mL when delivered through propellant HFA-134a. The time taken to reach these peak concentrations (Tmax) was noticeably longer with albuterol HFA (Tmax = 0.42 hours) compared to the CFC-propelled albuterol inhaler (Tmax = 0.17 hours). Distribution: The volume of distribution of albuterol is 156 ± 38 L. Elimination: Within 24 hours, approximately 70% of an albuterol dose is eliminated through urinary excretion, whereas 80% to 100% of albuterol and its metabolites are excreted within 72 hours after exposure. In humans, up to 10% of an albuterol dose is excreted in the feces. The half-life for oral inhalation formulation ranges from 3.8 to approximately 5 hours. The immediate-release oral formulation of albuterol has a half-life of 5 to 6 hours, whereas the extended-release oral formulation has a half-life of 9.3 hours."
Pyogenic granulomas and hemorrhage,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482272/,"[Bookshelf](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/ ""Bookshelf home"")",Adult Dosage,"To address acute or severe bronchospasm, it is recommended to utilize a nebulizer solution with a concentration of 2.5 to 5 mg every 20 minutes for 3 cycles. Subsequently, repeat nebulizer treatments of 2.5 to 10 mg are advised every 1 to 4 hours as needed. Alternatively, if using a metered-dose inhaler, the standard practice involves 4 to 8 puffs of 90 mcg every 20 minutes for up to 4 hours, followed by 4 to 8 puffs every 1 to 4 hours as needed. The recommendation for treating exercise-induced bronchospasm is to use an aerosol or powder metered-dose inhaler before exercise. Taking 2 puffs of 90 mcg (total 180 mcg) 15 to 20 minutes before exercise may help prevent symptoms."
Pyogenic granulomas and hemorrhage,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482272/,"[Bookshelf](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/ ""Bookshelf home"")",Pediatric Dosage,"The recommended nebulizer solution dosage for children aged 2 or younger is 0.2 to 0.6 mg/kg/d, divided into either a 4- or 6-hour cycle based on weight. For children aged 2 or older, a nebulizer solution dosing of 2.5 mg/0.5 mL is administered every 6 to 8 hours, with a maximum of 10 mg administered in 24 hours. Albuterol tablets with extended-release formulation are contraindicated in patients aged 6 or younger. The recommendation of albuterol dosage for pediatric patients aged 6 to 12 is 4 mg administered every 12 hours and should not exceed 24 mg in 24 hours. The recommended albuterol dosage for adolescent patients can be increased to 8 mg every 12 hours and not to exceed 32 mg in 24 hours. The syrup formulation of albuterol has not been studied in children aged 2 or younger. The recommended albuterol dosage for patients aged 2 to 6 is 0.1 mg/kg every 8 hours, which can be increased to 0.2 mg/kg every 8 hours as needed. For children aged 6 to 14, taking 2 mg of the medication every 6 to 8 hours is recommended. The recommended dosage for pediatric patients aged 14 and older is 2 to 4 mg every 6 to 8 hours, with a daily maximum of 32 mg."

This is due to the potential for an amplified impact of albuterol on the cardiovascular system in these cases.
Pyogenic granulomas and hemorrhage,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482272/,"[Bookshelf](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/ ""Bookshelf home"")",Warnings and Precautions,"**Cardiovascular effects:** Albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol, such as other β-adrenergic agonists, may induce clinically relevant cardiovascular responses, including changes in pulse rate, blood pressure levels, and symptomatic presentations. Although infrequent at recommended dosages, if encountered, discontinuation of the drug may be warranted. Furthermore, beta-agonists have been associated with ECG changes, including T wave flattening, QTc interval prolongation, and ST segment depression. The clinical implications of these ECG findings remain uncertain. Hence, prudence is advised, particularly in patients with underlying cardiovascular disorders. **Asthma deterioration:** Asthma may deteriorate acutely over hours or chronically over days. An increased requirement for albuterol may signify a destabilization of asthma, necessitating a re-evaluation of the patient and treatment regimen. Special consideration should be given to potentially incorporating anti-inflammatory agents, such as corticosteroids. **Use of anti-inflammatory agents:** Relying solely on β-adrenergic agonist bronchodilators may be insufficient and detrimental to patient outcomes. Therefore, early consideration of ICS is essential."

Similar to other β2-adrenergic receptor agonists, albuterol has been shown to cause an increase in liver aminotransferase concentrations on rare occasions. This specific toxicity reaction is more common in other β2-adrenergic receptor agonists, such as terbutaline, which is administered in much greater quantities, such as in the context of abating uterine contractions. Although overdose from inhaled albuterol is rare, recognizing the signs of albuterol toxicity is clinically significant."

Actinic keratoses and intraepithelial carcinomae,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/actinic-keratosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20353057,Shingles,Overview,"Shingles is a viral infection that causes a painful rash. Shingles can occur anywhere on your body. It typically looks like a single stripe of blisters that wraps around the left side or the right side of your torso. Shingles is caused by the varicella-zoster virus — the same virus that causes chickenpox. After you've had chickenpox, the virus stays in your body for the rest of your life. Years later, the virus may reactivate as shingles. Shingles isn't life-threatening. But it can be very painful. Vaccines can help lower the risk of shingles. Early treatment may shorten a shingles infection and lessen the chance of complications. The most common complication is postherpetic neuralgia. This is a painful condition that causes shingles pain for a long time after your blisters have cleared."
Actinic keratoses and intraepithelial carcinomae,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/actinic-keratosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20353057,Shingles,Symptoms,"Shingles symptoms usually affect only a small section on one side of your body. These symptoms may include: * Pain, burning or tingling * Sensitivity to touch * A red rash that begins a few days after the pain * Fluid-filled blisters that break open and crust over * Itching Some people also experience: * Fever * Headache * Sensitivity to light * Fatigue Pain is usually the first symptom of shingles. For some people, the pain can be intense. Depending on the location of the pain, it can sometimes be mistaken for problems with the heart, lungs or kidneys. Some people experience shingles pain without ever developing the rash. Most commonly, the shingles rash develops as a stripe of blisters that wraps around either the left or right side of the torso. Sometimes the shingles rash occurs around one eye or on one side of the neck or face."
Actinic keratoses and intraepithelial carcinomae,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/actinic-keratosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20353057,Shingles,Shingles,"Shingles is characterized by pain or a tingling sensation in a limited area on one side of the face or torso, followed by a red rash with small, fluid-filled blisters."
Actinic keratoses and intraepithelial carcinomae,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/actinic-keratosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20353057,Shingles,When to see a doctor,"Contact your health care provider as soon as possible if you suspect shingles, especially in the following situations: * The pain and rash occur near an eye. If left untreated, this infection may lead to permanent eye damage. * You're 50 or older. Age increases your risk of complications. * You or someone in your family has a weakened immune system. This may be due to cancer, medications or chronic illness. * The rash is widespread and painful."

Actinic keratoses and intraepithelial carcinomae,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/actinic-keratosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20353057,Shingles,Causes,"Shingles is caused by the varicella-zoster virus — the same virus that causes chickenpox. Anyone who's had chickenpox may develop shingles. After you recover from chickenpox, the virus enters your nervous system and stays inactive for years. Sometimes the virus reactivates and travels along nerve pathways to your skin — producing shingles. But not everyone who's had chickenpox will develop shingles. The reason for shingles is unclear. It may be due to lowered immunity to infections as people get older. Shingles is more common in older adults and in people who have weakened immune systems. Varicella-zoster is part of a group of viruses called herpes viruses. This is the same group that includes the viruses that cause cold sores and genital herpes. As a result, shingles is also known as herpes zoster. But the virus that causes chickenpox and shingles isn't the same virus that causes cold sores or genital herpes, which is a sexually transmitted infection."
Actinic keratoses and intraepithelial carcinomae,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/actinic-keratosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20353057,Shingles,Shingles affects the nerves,The shingles rash is associated with an inflammation of nerves beneath the skin.
Actinic keratoses and intraepithelial carcinomae,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/actinic-keratosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20353057,Shingles,Are you contagious?,"A person with shingles can pass the varicella-zoster virus to anyone who isn't immune to chickenpox. This usually occurs through direct contact with the open sores of the shingles rash. Once infected, though, the person will develop chickenpox rather than shingles. Chickenpox can be dangerous for some people. Until your shingles blisters scab over, you are contagious. Avoid physical contact with anyone who hasn't yet had chickenpox or the chickenpox vaccine. That includes people with weakened immune systems, pregnant women and newborns."
Actinic keratoses and intraepithelial carcinomae,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/actinic-keratosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20353057,Shingles,Risk factors,"Anyone who has ever had chickenpox can develop shingles. Most adults in the United States had chickenpox when they were children. That was before the availability of the routine childhood vaccination that now protects against chickenpox. Factors that may increase your risk of developing shingles include: * **Age.** The risk of developing shingles increases with age. Shingles typically occurs in people older than 50. And people over the age of 60 are more likely to experience more-severe complications. * **Some diseases.** Diseases that weaken your immune system, such as HIV/AIDS and cancer, can increase your risk of shingles. * **Cancer treatments.** Radiation or chemotherapy can lower your resistance to diseases and may trigger shingles. * **Some medications.** Drugs that prevent rejection of transplanted organs can increase your risk of shingles. Long-term use of steroids, such as prednisone, may also increase your risk of developing shingles."
Actinic keratoses and intraepithelial carcinomae,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/actinic-keratosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20353057,Shingles,Complications,"Complications from shingles can include: * **Postherpetic neuralgia.** For some people, shingles pain continues long after the blisters have cleared. This condition is known as postherpetic neuralgia. It occurs when damaged nerve fibers send confused and exaggerated messages of pain from your skin to your brain. * **Vision loss.** Shingles in or around an eye (ophthalmic shingles) can cause painful eye infections that may result in vision loss. * **Neurological problems.** Shingles may cause inflammation of the brain (encephalitis), facial paralysis, or problems with hearing or balance. * **Skin infections.** If shingles blisters aren't properly treated, bacterial skin infections may develop."
Actinic keratoses and intraepithelial carcinomae,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/actinic-keratosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20353057,Shingles,Prevention,"A shingles vaccine may help prevent shingles. People who are eligible should get the Shingrix vaccine, which has been available in the United States since its approval by the Food and Drug Administration in 2017. The Zostavax vaccine is no longer available in the U.S., but other countries may still use it. Shingrix is approved and recommended for people age 50 and older, whether they've had shingles or not. People who've had the Zostavax vaccine in the past or don't know whether they've had chickenpox may also receive the Shingrix vaccine. Shingrix is also recommended for people who are 19 years of age and older who have weakened immune systems due to disease or medication. Shingrix is a nonliving vaccine made of a virus component. It's given in two doses, with 2 to 6 months between doses. The most common side effects of the shingles vaccine are redness, pain and swelling at the injection site. Some people also experience fatigue, headache and other side effects. The shingles vaccine doesn't guarantee that you won't get shingles. But this vaccine will likely reduce the course and severity of the disease. And it will likely lower your risk of postherpetic neuralgia. Studies suggest that Shingrix offers protection against shingles for more than five years. Talk to your health care provider about your vaccination options if you: * Have had an allergic reaction to any component of the shingles vaccine * Have a weakened immune system due to a condition or medication * Have had a stem cell transplant * Are pregnant or trying to become pregnant The shingles vaccine is used only as a way to prevent shingles. It's not intended to treat people who currently have the disease. Aug 20, 2022 2. Anderson TC, et al.

In young men, these fractures are usually a result of high-energy trauma while in the older population, these fractures are typically seen in women after a ground-level fall. Interestingly, humerus shaft fractures in polytrauma patients are independent predictors of intra-abdominal injury, long bone, and hand fractures. Typically, these injuries cause temporary disability in the younger population whereas permanent disability can be seen in the elderly population. This activity describes the evaluation, diagnosis, and management of humerus fractures and stresses the role of team-based interprofessional care for affected patients."

In closed fractures, this is often a result of neuropraxia, while in open fractures it is a result so neurogenesis. This complication is more common in third distal fractures as this is the location where the radial nerve is closest to the humerus. In a closed fracture, radial nerve palsy is not an indication for open reduction and internal fixation with nerve exploration. Most palsies return with no treatment in 3 to 6 months. If no return of function is seen at 3 to 4 months, an EMG should be performed. Surgical exploration is indicated in open fractures, a closed fracture with the failure of improvement over 3 to 6 months, and fibrillations at 3 to 4 months on EMG."

These are classified as the greater and lesser tuberosity, articular surface, and shaft displaced more than 1 cm or greater than 45 degrees. Distal humerus fractures comprise of supracondylar fractures, single condyle fractures, bicolumnar fractures, and coronal shear fractures. These fractures can be classified as supracondylar fractures and distal single-column fractures and subclassified using the Milch classification. Milch type I fractures are fractures through the lateral trochlear ridge compared to Milch type II fractures with the lateral trochlear ridge intact. The Jupiter classification is used to identify five articular fragments: (1) the capitellum/lateral trochlea, (2) lateral epicondyle, (3) posterolateral epicondyle, (4) posterior trochlea, and (5)medial trochlea/epicondyle. With distal humerus fractures, if the elbow is flexed less than 90 degrees, a transcolumnar fracture is seen and a direct posterior injury results in an olecranon fracture compared to elbow flexion greater than 90 degrees with an intercondylar fracture."

Actinic keratoses and intraepithelial carcinomae,https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000858.htm,Shingles,Causes,"Expand Section After you get chickenpox, your body does not get rid of the virus. Instead, the virus remains in the body but is inactive (becomes dormant) in certain nerves in the body. Shingles occurs after the virus becomes active again in these nerves after many years. Many people had such a mild case of chickenpox that they do not realize they have had the infection. The reason the virus suddenly becomes active again is not clear. Often only one attack occurs. Shingles can develop in any age group. You are more likely to develop the condition if: * You are older than age 60 * You had chickenpox before age 1 * Your immune system is weakened by medicines or disease"
Actinic keratoses and intraepithelial carcinomae,https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000858.htm,Shingles,Exams and Tests,"Expand Section Your health care provider can make the diagnosis by looking at your skin and asking about your medical history.

Actinic keratoses and intraepithelial carcinomae,https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000858.htm,Shingles,Treatment,"Expand Section Your provider may prescribe a medicine that fights the virus, called an antiviral drug. This drug helps reduce pain, prevent complications, and shorten the course of the disease. The medicines are most effective when started within 72 hours of when you first feel pain or burning. It is best to start taking them before the blisters appear. The medicines are usually given in pill form. Some people may need to receive the medicine through a vein (by IV). Strong anti-inflammatory medicines called corticosteroids, such as prednisone, may be used to reduce swelling and pain. These medicines do not work in all people. Other medicines may include: * Antihistamines to reduce itching (taken by mouth or applied to the skin) * Pain medicines * Zostrix, a cream containing capsaicin (an extract of pepper) to reduce pain Other measures may include: * Caring for your skin by applying cool, wet compresses to reduce pain, and taking soothing baths * Resting in bed until the fever goes down Stay away from people while your sores are oozing to avoid infecting those who have never had chickenpox -- especially pregnant women."

Updated January 2016. Revised September 2020"
Dermatofibroma,https://dermnetnz.org/topics/dermatofibroma,**Dermatofibroma**,What is a dermatofibroma?,A dermatofibroma is a common benign fibrous nodule usually found on the skin of the lower legs. A dermatofibroma is also called a cutaneous fibrous histiocytoma.
Dermatofibroma,https://dermnetnz.org/topics/dermatofibroma,**Dermatofibroma**,Who gets a dermatofibroma?,"Dermatofibromas are mostly seen in adults. People of every ethnicity can develop dermatofibromas. Ordinary dermatofibromas are more common in women than in men, although some histologic variants are more commonly identified in males."
Dermatofibroma,https://dermnetnz.org/topics/dermatofibroma,**Dermatofibroma**,What causes dermatofibroma?,"It is not clear if dermatofibroma is a reactive process or a true neoplasm. The lesions are composed of proliferating fibroblasts. Histiocytes may also be involved. They are sometimes attributed to minor trauma including insect bites, injections, or a rose thorn injury, but not consistently. Multiple dermatofibromas can develop in patients with altered immunity such as HIV, immunosuppression, or autoimmune conditions."
Dermatofibroma,https://dermnetnz.org/topics/dermatofibroma,**Dermatofibroma**,What are the clinical features of dermatofibroma?,"A dermatofibroma usually presents as a solitary firm papule or nodule on a limb. * A dermatofibroma can occur anywhere on the skin. * Dermatofibroma size varies from 0.5–1.5 cm diameter; most lesions are 7–10 mm diameter. * A dermatofibroma is tethered to the skin surface and mobile over subcutaneous tissue. * The overlying skin dimples on pinching the lesion – the dimple or pinch sign. * Colour may be pink to light brown in white skin, and dark brown to black in dark skin; some appear paler in the centre. * Dermatofibromas do not usually cause symptoms, but they are sometimes painful, tender, or itchy. Clinical variants include giant, eruptive, and multiple forms. Dermatofibroma Dermatofibroma Dermatofibroma Dermatofibroma Pinch sign of dermatofibroma Dermoscopy of dermatofibroma"
Dermatofibroma,https://dermnetnz.org/topics/dermatofibroma,**Dermatofibroma**,What are the complications of dermatofibroma?,"Because dermatofibromas are often raised lesions, they may be traumatised, for example by a razor. Occasionally dozens may erupt within a few months, usually in the setting of immunosuppression."
Dermatofibroma,https://dermnetnz.org/topics/dermatofibroma,**Dermatofibroma**,How is a dermatofibroma diagnosed?,* cellular * aneurysmal * epithelioid * atypical * lipidized ankle-type * palisading * cholesterotic
Dermatofibroma,https://dermnetnz.org/topics/dermatofibroma,**Dermatofibroma**,What is the treatment for dermatofibroma?,"A dermatofibroma is harmless and seldom causes any symptoms. Usually, only reassurance is needed. If it is nuisance or causing concern, the lesion can be removed surgically. Recurrence is common as the lesion often extends beyond the clinical margin."

Dermatofibroma,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/dermatofibroma/symptoms-causes/syc-20350354,Croup,Diagnosis,Croup is usually diagnosed by a health care provider. The provider: * Observes your child's breathing. * Listens to your child's chest with a stethoscope. * Examines your child's throat. Sometimes X-rays or other tests are used to rule out other possible illnesses.
Dermatofibroma,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/dermatofibroma/symptoms-causes/syc-20350354,Croup,Treatment,"Most children with croup can be treated at home. Still, croup can be scary, especially if your child needs a visit to the health care provider's office, emergency room or hospital. Treatment is usually based on how severe the symptoms are."
Dermatofibroma,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/dermatofibroma/symptoms-causes/syc-20350354,Croup,Comfort measures,"It's important to comfort and calm your child because crying and distress can worsen airway swelling, making it harder to breathe. Hold your child, sing lullabies or read quiet stories. Offer a favorite blanket or toy. Speak in a soothing voice. Also, make sure that your child drinks plenty of fluids to stay hydrated."
Dermatofibroma,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/dermatofibroma/symptoms-causes/syc-20350354,Croup,Medicines,"Your child's health care provider may prescribe these medicines: * **Corticosteroid.** A corticosteroid — such as dexamethasone — may be given to reduce swelling in the airway. Symptoms will usually start to improve within a few hours. Your child may take pills over several days. Or your child may get a single dose of dexamethasone as a shot because of its long-lasting effects. * **Epinephrine.** Epinephrine is effective in reducing airway swelling with more-severe symptoms. The medicine may be given in an inhaled form using a nebulizer. It's fast acting, but its effects wear off quickly. Your child likely will need to be observed in the emergency room for several hours to see if a second dose is needed before going home."
Dermatofibroma,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/dermatofibroma/symptoms-causes/syc-20350354,Croup,A stay in the hospital,"For severe croup, your child may need to spend time in a hospital to be monitored and receive more treatments."

Dermatofibroma,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/dermatofibroma/symptoms-causes/syc-20350354,Croup,Self care,"Croup often runs its course within 3 to 5 days. In the meantime, keep your child comfortable with a few simple measures: * **Stay calm.** Comfort or distract your child — cuddle, read a book or play a quiet game. Crying makes breathing more difficult. * **Provide humidified or cool air.** Although there's no evidence of benefit from these practices, many parents believe that humid air or cool air helps a child's breathing. For moist air, you can use a humidifier. You can also sit with the child in a bathroom filled with steam created by running hot water from the shower. If it's cool outside, you can open a window for your child to breathe the cool air. * **Hold your child in a comfortable upright position.** Hold your child on your lap, or place your child in a favorite chair or infant seat. Sitting upright may make breathing easier. * **Offer fluids.** For babies, breast milk or formula is fine. For older children, soup or frozen fruit pops may be soothing. * **Encourage rest.** Sleep can help your child fight the infection. * **Try a fever reducer.** For treatment of fever or pain, consider giving your child infants' or children's over-the-counter fever and pain medicines such as acetaminophen (Tylenol, others) or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, others) as a safer alternative to aspirin. Read the directions carefully for dosing. Ask your health care provider about the right dose if you're not sure. Use caution when giving aspirin to children or teenagers. Though aspirin is approved for use in children older than age 3, children and teenagers recovering from chickenpox or flu-like symptoms should never take aspirin. This is because aspirin has been linked to Reye's syndrome, a rare but potentially life-threatening condition, in such children. * **Skip the cold medicines.** Cold preparations available without a prescription aren't recommended for children of any age. And they can be harmful in children under than 2 years old. Plus, nonprescription cough medicines won't help croup. Your child's cough may improve during the day, but don't be surprised if it returns at night. You may want to sleep near your child or even in the same room so that you can take quick action if symptoms worsen."
Dermatofibroma,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/dermatofibroma/symptoms-causes/syc-20350354,Croup,Preparing for your appointment,"In most cases of croup, your child won't need to see a health care provider. However, if symptoms are severe or aren't responding to home treatment, you should call your provider."
Dermatofibroma,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/dermatofibroma/symptoms-causes/syc-20350354,Croup,What you can do,"Before your appointment, make a list of: * **Your child's symptoms,** including how long they have been occurring and what, if anything, makes them better or worse. * **Any medicine your child is taking,** including over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, herbs and other supplements, and their doses. * **Questions to ask your child's health care provider.**"
Dermatofibroma,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/dermatofibroma/symptoms-causes/syc-20350354,Croup,What to expect from your doctor,"Your child's health care provider will likely ask a number of questions to help determine the best course of treatment: * What are your child's symptoms? * Has your child had a fever or difficulty swallowing? * How long has your child been experiencing symptoms? * Has your child's cough become worse over time? If so, how rapidly? * Have you noticed a pattern to your child's cough? For instance, does it get worse at night? * Has your child had croup in the past? * Has your child recently been exposed to other sick children? * Does your child have any other medical conditions? * Are your child's vaccinations up to date? Your health care provider will ask other questions based on your answers and your child's symptoms and needs. Preparing and anticipating questions will help you make the most of your time with the provider. Dec 03, 2022 1. AskMayoExpert. Croup (child). Mayo Clinic; 2021. 5. Smith DK, et al.
