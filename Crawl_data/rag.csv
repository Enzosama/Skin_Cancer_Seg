Melanocytic nevi,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/moles/symptoms-causes/syc-20375200,[Moles](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/moles/symptoms-causes/syc-20375200),Moles (Melanocytic nevi),"Moles are usually harmless. They may contain hairs or become raised or wrinkled. Talk to your doctor about any change in the color or size of a mole or if itching, pain, bleeding or inflammation develops.
Moles, also known as nevi, are a common type of skin growth. They often appear as small, dark brown spots that are caused by clusters of pigment-forming cells called melanocytes. Most people have 10 to 45 moles that appear during childhood and the teenage years. How these moles look may change over time. They also may fade over time.
Most moles are harmless. Rarely, they become cancerous. Being aware of changes in your moles and other pigmented patches is important to finding skin cancer, especially malignant melanoma."

But moles come in different colors, shapes and sizes:
* **Color and texture.** Moles can be brown, tan, black, blue, red or pink. They can be smooth, wrinkled, flat or raised. They may have hair growing from them.
* **Shape.** Most moles are oval or round.
* **Size.** Moles are typically less than 1/4 inch (about 6 mm) in diameter — the size of a pencil eraser. Those present at birth, known as congenital nevi, can be bigger and cover part of the face, trunk or a limb.

Moles can grow anywhere on your body, including your scalp and armpits, as well as under your nails and between your fingers and toes. Most people have 10 to 45 moles. Many of these moles occur by age 40. Moles may change or fade away over time. They may become darker and larger with hormonal changes that occur during the teenage years and while pregnant.
Clusters of brown spots around the eyes, cheeks and nose are dermatoses papulosa nigra — a type of seborrheic keratosis that is noncancerous and appears as waxy brown, black or tan growths. They aren't clusters of pigment-forming cells, known as nevi. Dermatoses papulosa nigra are more common among Black women. These lesions don't carry a risk of melanoma, but they can be treated as a cosmetic concern."

This ABCDE guide can help you remember what to watch for:
* **A is for asymmetrical shape.** One half is unlike the other half.
* **B is for border.** Look for moles with irregular, notched or scalloped borders.
* **C is for changes in color.** Look for growths that have changed color, have many colors or have uneven color.
* **D is for diameter.** Look for new growth in a mole larger than 1/4 inch (about 6 mm).
* **E is for evolving.** Watch for moles that change in size, shape, color or height. Also, new symptoms can arise, such as itchiness or bleeding.

Cancerous moles, also known as malignant moles, vary greatly in how they look. Some may show all of the changes listed above. Others may have only one or two unusual traits."

Some people have an above-average risk of their moles becoming cancerous and leading to melanoma. Factors that raise melanoma risk include:
* **Being born with large moles.** These type of moles are called congenital nevi. They are subclassified based on their estimated adult size. Large and giant congenital nevi that are more than 20 centimeters in diameter are at higher risk of developing melanoma.
* **Having unusual moles.** Moles that are large with an irregular border are known as atypical nevi, also known as dysplastic nevi. They tend to run in families.
* **Having many moles.** Having more than 50 moles suggests a greater risk of melanoma and possibly breast cancer.
* **Having a personal or family history of melanoma.** If you've had melanoma before, there is a higher risk of getting melanoma again. Also, some types of atypical nevi lead to a genetic form of melanoma.
* **Using tanning lamps or beds.** Tanning lamps and beds release UV rays and can raise your risk of skin cancer."

During a skin exam, your healthcare professional looks at your skin from head to toe. If your healthcare professional thinks that a mole may be cancerous, it is removed and sent to a lab for examination under a microscope. This is called a biopsy.
You might choose to make a skin exam a regular part of your preventive medical care. Talk with your healthcare professional about the schedule that's right for you."
Melanocytic nevi,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/moles/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20375204,[Moles](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/moles/symptoms-causes/syc-20375200),Treatment (Melanocytic nevi),"Most moles don't need treatment. If you're self-conscious about a mole, you could try makeup to help hide it. If you have a hair growing from a mole, you might try clipping it close to the skin's surface or plucking it. Anytime you cut or irritate a mole, keep the area clean. See your healthcare professional if a mole doesn't heal.
You also might talk with your dermatologist about surgically removing a mole if it bothers you or if you notice suspicious changes in it. Mole removal is a quick procedure that is typically done on an outpatient basis. During mole removal, your healthcare professional numbs the area around the mole and cuts it out, along with a margin of healthy skin if needed. The procedure may leave a permanent scar. People with Black skin are at increased risk of other surgical side effects, such as pigmentary changes where the cut is, and keloid scars, which are raised scars after an injury heals.
If you notice that a mole has grown back, see your healthcare professional promptly."

* **Bring a list of all medicines,** vitamins or supplements that you take.
* **If you've had a melanoma or a mole removed in the past,** note the location of the lesion and the date of removal. If you have the biopsy report, bring it with you.
* **Don't wear makeup or opaque nail polish to your appointment.** These products make it hard for your healthcare professional to do a thorough exam.
* **List questions to ask** your healthcare professional.

For moles, some basic questions to ask your healthcare professional include:
* Do you think this mole might be cancerous?
* What's the best course of action?
* How can I tell if a mole needs to be looked at?
* Can I keep more moles from growing?
* Do you have any brochures or other printed material that I can take home with me? What websites do you recommend?

_International_"
Melanocytic nevi,https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1058445-overview,Melanocytic Nevi,Race (Melanocytic nevi),"Melanocytic nevi are common lesions in patients with light or fair skin and are less common lesions in dark-skinned individuals. This difference in prevalence is in part attributable to the fact that identifying moles in dark-skinned patients is often difficult, especially if the lesions are macular (flat)."
Melanocytic nevi,https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1058445-overview,Melanocytic Nevi,Sex (Melanocytic nevi),"No clear sex predilection is reported for the development of melanocytic nevi. However, melanocytes have been postulated to exhibit some degree of sex hormone responsiveness. The findings associated with melanocytic nevi during pregnancy support this conclusion. Melanocytic nevi commonly darken and/or enlarge during pregnancy. Melanocytes have been shown to have cytosolic receptors for estrogens and androgens, and melanogenesis is responsive to these steroid hormones. Some melanomas seem to respond to hormones, an observation that might be explained by these cytosolic receptors.
Subtle differences may exist in the prevalence of melanocytic nevi between women and men. Judging the incidence and prevalence based on available biopsy data is difficult because women may be more likely to seek medical attention. If sex-specific variations in incidence do exist, the differences may be site specific. For example, specific histopathological features are commonly observed in melanocytic nevi that occur within genital skin. These features are noted almost exclusively within biopsy specimens from women, although similar alterations can occasionally be observed in melanocytic nevi from males.
From the author's database (at the University of California, San Francisco), data clearly show that biopsies of genital melanocytic nevi are much more commonly performed in women than in men. These data do not unequivocally confirm that the prevalence of genital melanocytic nevi is truly increased in women, although this seems likely."
Melanocytic nevi,https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1058445-treatment,Melanocytic Nevi Treatment & Management,Medical Care (Melanocytic nevi),Medical treatment is typically ineffective and inappropriate for the management of a benign neoplasm such as a melanocytic nevus.
Melanocytic nevi,https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/4410-moles,Moles,What is a skin mole? What does one look like? (Melanocytic nevi),"Most skin moles appear in early childhood and during the first 20 years of life. It is normal for a person to have between 10 to 40 moles by adulthood.
The life cycle of an average mole is about 50 years. As the years pass, moles usually change slowly, becoming raised and lighter in color. Often, hairs develop on the mole. Some moles will not change at all and some will slowly disappear over time."
Melanocytic nevi,https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/4410-moles,Moles,What are the types of skin moles? (Melanocytic nevi),"* **Common Nevi:** This is a normal mole, a small growth on your skin that’s pink, tan, or brown and has a distinct edge."
Melanocytic nevi,https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/4410-moles,Moles,How common are moles? (Melanocytic nevi),Moles are very common. Most people have about 10 to 40 of them.
Melanocytic nevi,https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/4410-moles,Moles,Where do moles most commonly occur? (Melanocytic nevi),Most moles grow on parts of your body that get sunlight (ultraviolet radiation). You might see that you get more moles the longer you’re in the sun.
Melanocytic nevi,https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/4410-moles,Moles,Are moles contagious? (Melanocytic nevi),"No, moles are not contagious."

Melanocytic nevi,https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/4410-moles,Moles,What causes skin moles? (Melanocytic nevi),"Moles occur when cells in your skin grow in a cluster instead of being spread throughout the skin. Most moles are made of cells called melanocytes, which make the pigment that gives your skin its natural color."
Melanocytic nevi,https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/4410-moles,Moles,What are the risk factors for skin moles? (Melanocytic nevi),Excessive sunlight.
Melanocytic nevi,https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/4410-moles,Moles,What makes skin moles darker? (Melanocytic nevi),"Moles may get darker after sun exposure, during pregnancy and during puberty. During pregnancy, moles often change evenly due to hormonal effects. For example, they may darken or become larger. However, if a mole changes in an irregular or uneven manner, have it evaluated by a dermatologist."
Melanocytic nevi,https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/4410-moles,Moles,Why should I check my skin for moles? (Melanocytic nevi),"The skin is the largest organ in the human body and one of the few organs you can see. Being proactive about preventing skin cancer is important for your health. This is especially true if:
* You have fair skin.
* You have many moles on your body.

In addition to limiting your exposure to sunlight and using sunscreen every day, examining your moles increases the chances of early detection and treatment of melanoma and other types of skin cancers."
Melanocytic nevi,https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/4410-moles,Moles,What should I look for when examining my skin moles? (Melanocytic nevi),"Most skin moles are benign (non-cancerous). The moles that are of medical concern are those that look different than other existing moles on your body (referred to as the “ugly duckling sign”) or those that appear on your skin after age 30. If you notice changes in any mole's color, thickness, size, or shape, you should see a dermatologist. You also should have your moles checked if they bleed, ooze, itch, scale, or become tender or painful.
Examine your skin with a mirror or ask someone to help you. Pay special attention to areas of your skin that are often exposed to the sun, such as your face, hands, legs (especially in females), arms, chest and back (especially in men).
* **A** symmetry: If one half of your skin mole does not match the other half.
* **B** order: If the border or edges of your mole are ragged, blurred or irregular.
* **C** olor: If the color of your mole is not the same throughout, or it has shades of multiple colors such as tan, brown, black, blue, white, or red.
* **D** iameter: If the diameter of your mole is larger than the eraser of a pencil.
* **E** levation/Evolution: If your mole becomes raised after being flat, or it changes over a short period of time.

The most common location for melanoma in men is the back; in women, it is the lower leg. Melanoma is the most common cancer in women ages 25 to 29."
Melanocytic nevi,https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/4410-moles,Moles,How does a dermatologist determine if moles are a concern? (Melanocytic nevi),"Normal (benign) skin moles do not need to be removed (doing so will leave a scar).
If you are concerned that a mole is changing or if you see worrisome signs, please contact your dermatologist to have the mole examined."
Melanocytic nevi,https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/4410-moles,Moles,Who will treat/manage my moles? (Melanocytic nevi),"Your usual healthcare provider might refer you to a dermatologist, a healthcare provider who specializes in skin."
Melanocytic nevi,https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/4410-moles,Moles,Should skin moles be removed? (Melanocytic nevi),"A normal skin mole does not need to be removed. If you choose to have it removed, you’ll likely be left with a scar."
Melanocytic nevi,https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/4410-moles,Moles,How are skin moles removed? (Melanocytic nevi),"Don’t try to remove a mole by yourself, even if you’re using some sort of over-the-counter product that burns, freezes, or uses lasers to remove skin growths like skin tags, moles and freckles. Not only could you get an infection, but you could unknowingly remove melanoma (skin cancer). Skin cancer can spread to other organs if it’s not caught early, and one way to catch it is to identify an abnormal mole."
Melanocytic nevi,https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/4410-moles,Moles,What are the at-home treatments for moles? (Melanocytic nevi),"Healthcare providers recommend that you do not use any at-home treatments on your moles. If you have a concern, talk to a dermatologist.
Care at Cleveland Clinic"
Melanocytic nevi,https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/4410-moles,Moles,Can moles be prevented? (Melanocytic nevi),"Moles are natural skin growths that can’t be prevented. However, you can be proactive about preventing skin cancer (or catching it early) by:
* Limiting how much sunlight you get.
* Wearing sunscreen every day.
* Examining your moles at least once a month, looking for irregularities.

Being proactive about preventing skin cancer is important for your health. This is especially true if:
* You have fair skin.
* You have many moles on your body.
* Your immediate family members have many moles, atypical moles, or a history of skin cancer.

In addition to limiting your exposure to sunlight and using sunscreen every day, examining your moles increases the chances of early detection and treatment of melanoma and other types of skin cancers.
Dermatologists recommend that you examine your skin every month. Most moles are benign (non-cancerous). If you notice changes in a mole's color or appearance, have your mole evaluated by a dermatologist. You also should have moles checked if they bleed, ooze, itch, appear scaly, or become tender or painful."
Melanocytic nevi,https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/4410-moles,Moles,How should I examine my skin for moles? (Melanocytic nevi),"* Perform skin self-examinations every month. It is best if you examine your skin after a bath or shower, while your skin is still wet.
* Use a full-length mirror (if you have one), as well as a hand mirror, for a closer view. Ask a family member, if available, for help for the more difficult sites, such as your back.
* Try to examine yourself the same way every month to avoid missing any areas. Start at your head and work your way down. Look at all the areas of your body (including the front, backs and sides of each area, and your fingernails and toenails). Also be sure to check the “hidden” areas: between your fingers and toes, your groin, the soles of your feet and the backs of your knees.
* Don't forget to thoroughly check your scalp and neck for moles.
* Keep track of all the moles on your body and what they look like. Take a photo with a ruler in it and date it. That way, you'll notice if the moles change. If they do change in any way (in color, shape, size, border, etc.), or if you develop a sore that does not heal, you should see a dermatologist. Also have your dermatologist examine any new moles that you think are suspicious.

You should always be suspicious of a new mole that develops after the age of 30. Many of the growths that appear after age 30 are harmless age-associated growths rather than moles; however, if you do notice a new growth, you should see your dermatologist. He or she will examine the growth and perform a skin biopsy, if indicated."
Melanocytic nevi,https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/4410-moles,Moles,What are the complications of moles? (Melanocytic nevi),The most significant complication is that some moles can turn into melanoma.

Melanocytic nevi,https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/4410-moles,Moles,Can skin moles go away on their own? (Melanocytic nevi),Yes. 50 years is about the maximum time for a mole.
Melanocytic nevi,https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/4410-moles,Moles,How do I take care of my skin moles? (Melanocytic nevi),"You don’t need to treat your moles any differently than the rest of your skin, except for examining them at least once a month."
Melanocytic nevi,https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/4410-moles,Moles,A note from Cleveland Clinic (Melanocytic nevi),"Most people get moles. They’re common, normal. Moles are almost always harmless. Just keep an eye out for any irregularity by checking or having someone you trust check for you once a month. Remember, if a mole displays any of the signs listed below, have it checked immediately:
* **A** symmetry: If one half of your skin mole does not match the other half.
* **B** order: If the border or edges of your mole are ragged, blurred or irregular.
* **C** olor: If the color of your mole is not the same throughout, or it has shades of multiple colors such as tan, brown, black, blue, white, or red.

Melanocytic nevi,https://dermnetnz.org/topics/melanocytic-naevus,**Melanocytic naevus**,Who gets melanocytic naevi? (Melanocytic nevi),"Almost everyone has at least one melanocytic naevus.
* About 1% of individuals are born with one or more congenital melanocytic naevi. This is usually sporadic, with rare instances of familial congenital naevi.
* Fair-skinned people tend to have more melanocytic naevi than darker skinned people.
* Melanocytic naevi that appear during childhood (aged 2 to 10 years) tend to be the most prominent and persistent throughout life.
* Melanocytic naevi that are acquired later in childhood or adult life often follow sun exposure and may fade away or involute later.

Most white-skinned New Zealanders have 20–50 melanocytic naevi."
Melanocytic nevi,https://dermnetnz.org/topics/melanocytic-naevus,**Melanocytic naevus**,What causes melanocytic naevi? (Melanocytic nevi),"Although the exact reason for the local proliferation of naevus cells is unknown, it is clear that the number of melanocytic naevi a person has depends on genetic factors, on sun exposure, and on immune status.
* People with many melanocytic naevi tend to have family members that also have many similar lesions.
* People living in Australia and New Zealand have many more naevi than their relatives residing in Northern Europe."
Melanocytic nevi,https://dermnetnz.org/topics/melanocytic-naevus,**Melanocytic naevus**,What are the clinical features of melanocytic naevi? (Melanocytic nevi),"Melanocytic naevi vary widely in clinical, dermatoscopic and histological appearance.
* They may arise on any part of the body.
* They differ in appearance depending on the body site.
* They may be flat or protruding.
* They vary in colour from pink or flesh tones to dark brown, steel blue, or black.
* Light-skinned individuals tend to have light-coloured naevi and dark-skinned individuals tend to have dark brown or black naevi.
* Although mostly round or oval in shape, moles are sometimes unusual shapes.
* They range in size from a couple of millimetres to several centimetres in diameter."
Melanocytic nevi,https://dermnetnz.org/topics/melanocytic-naevus,**Melanocytic naevus**,Congenital melanocytic naevus (Melanocytic nevi),"Small congenital naevus | Medium congenital naevus | Giant naevus | Hairy congenital naevus
---|---|---|---
Small congenital naevus is 1.5 cm diameter. | Medium congenital naevi are 1.5–19.9 cm diameter. | A large or giant congenital melanocytic naevus is ≥ 20 cm | Hairy congenital naevi grow thick long hairs.
Café au lait macule | Speckled lentiginous naevus | Naevus of Ota | Mongolian spot
---|---|---|---
The pathological classification of melanocytic naevi relates to where naevus cells are found in the skin.
Junctional naevus | Dermal naevus | Compound naevus | Combined naevus
---|---|---|---
A junctional naevus has groups or nests of naevus cells at the junction of the epidermis and the dermis. A flat mole. | A dermal or intradermal naevus has naevus cell nests in the dermis. A papule, plaque or nodule with a pedunculated, papillomatous (Unna naevus) or smooth surface (Miescher naevus). | A compound naevus has nests of naevus cells at the epidermal-dermal junction as well as within the dermis. A central raised area surrounded by a flat patch. | A combined naevus has two distinct types of mole within the same lesion – usually blue naevus and compound naevus.
Reticular naevus | Globular naevus | Blue naevus | Starburst naevus
---|---|---|---
Reticular naevus reveals a lattice of intersecting brown lines. | Globular naevus characteristically shows aggregated brown oval structures. | The blue naevus is a uniform structureless lesion, steel blue in colour. | Starburst naevus reveals radial lines around the periphery of the lesion.
Site-related naevus: facial | Site-related naevus: acral | Naevus with special features | Unclassifiable naevus

Melanocytic nevi,https://dermnetnz.org/topics/melanocytic-naevus,**Melanocytic naevus**,Acquired melanocytic naevus (Melanocytic nevi),"Ordinary moles that appear after birth may be referred to as acquired naevi. Acquired melanocytic naevi are given a variety of names and there is considerable overlap of descriptions.
Signature naevi are the predominant group of naevi in an individual with multiple moles.
Solid brown naevus | Solid pink naevus | Eclipse naevus | Cockade naevus
---|---|---|---
Solid brown naevi have uniform brown pigmentation. | Solid pink naevi are seen in fair-skinned individuals and lack melanin pigmentation. | Eclipse naevus has a ring, or segment of a ring, of darker pigment around a tan or pink centre. Often found in the scalp. | Cockade, or naevus en cocarde/cockade, has a central dark naevus surrounded by concentric circles of light and dark pigmentation like a rosette.
Naevus with perifollicular hypopigmentation | Fried-egg naevus | Lentiginous naevus | Naevus with eccentric pigmentation
---|---|---|---
Naevi with perifollicular hypopigmentation have white spots around each hair. Easier to see by dermoscopy. | Fried-egg naevus is a compound naevus with a flat rim of pigment around a bumpy central portion – the bump can be lighter or darker than the pigmented rim. | Lentiginous naevi are small, dark brown or black, flat lesions, often with a slightly paler rim – people with multiple lentiginous naevi have been said to have cheetah phenotype. | The Bolognia sign refers to a harmless, small area of darker colour on one side of the naevus.
Uncommon types of melanocytic naevi include:
* Reed naevus: darkly pigmented type of Spitz naevus with starburst dermatoscopic pattern
* Agminated naevi: a cluster of similar moles
* Kissing naevus: adjacent melanocytic naevi on upper and lower eyelids, due to naevus formation prior to separation of eyelids _in utero._

* A melanocytic naevus with specific characteristics: large (> 5 mm); ill-defined or irregular borders; varying shades of colour; with flat and bumpy components.
* Or, any funny-looking naevus; large, or different from the patient’s other naevi.

Atypical naevi usually occur in fair-skinned individuals and are due to sun exposure. They may be solitary or numerous. Pathology is reported as dysplastic junctional or compound naevus and has specific histological features (the Clark naevus).
Common naevus | Naevus in dark skin | Atypical naevus | Dysplastic naevus
---|---|---|---
A common naevus is a flat mole with a single uniform colour. | In dark skin, naevi are often black in colour. | People with multiple atypical naevi are at increased risk of melanoma (cancerous mole). | Dysplastic naevus describes an atypical mole that has specific histological criteria.
Blue naevus | Cellular naevus | Miescher naevus | Unna naevus
---|---|---|---
Meyerson naevus | Halo naevus | Spitz naevus | Reed naevus
---|---|---|---
Recurrent naevus | Agminated naevus | Acral naevus | Nail unit naevus
---|---|---|---
Recurrent naevus refers to the reappearance of pigment in a scar following surgical removal of a mole – this may have an odd shape. | An agminated naevus is a cluster of similar moles or freckles. | Acral naevus refers to one on the palm or sole. | Nail unit naevus causes a uniform longitudinal band of pigment on a nail."
Melanocytic nevi,https://dermnetnz.org/topics/melanocytic-naevus,**Melanocytic naevus**,What are the complications of melanocytic naevi? (Melanocytic nevi),"* At first, melanoma may look similar to a harmless melanocytic naevus, but in time it becomes more disordered in structure and tends to enlarge.
* People with a greater number of naevi have a higher risk of developing melanoma than those with few naevi, especially if they have over 100 of them.

Melanocytic naevi sometimes change for other reasons than melanoma, for example following sun exposure or during pregnancy. They can enlarge, regress or involute (disappear).
* A recurrent naevus is one that appears in a scar following surgical removal of a melanocytic naevus — this may have an odd shape."
Melanocytic nevi,https://dermnetnz.org/topics/melanocytic-naevus,**Melanocytic naevus**,How is a melanocytic naevus diagnosed? (Melanocytic nevi),"Melanocytic naevi are usually diagnosed clinically by their typical appearance. If there is any doubt about the diagnosis, an expert may be consulted in person or with the help of clinical and dermatoscopic images. This is especially important if:
* A naevus changes size, shape, structure or colour
* A new naevus develops in adult life (> 40 years)
* It appears different from the person’s other naevi (a so-called ugly duckling)
* It has ABCD characteristics (Asymmetry, Border irregularity, Colour variation, Diameter > 6 mm)
* It is bleeding, crusted or itchy."
Melanocytic nevi,https://dermnetnz.org/topics/melanocytic-naevus,**Melanocytic naevus**,What is the treatment for melanocytic naevus? (Melanocytic nevi),"Most melanocytic naevi are harmless and can be safely left alone. They may be removed in the following circumstances:
* To exclude cancer
* If a naevus is a nuisance: perhaps irritated by clothing, comb or razor
* Cosmetic reasons: the mole is unsightly.

Surgical techniques include:"
Melanocytic nevi,https://dermnetnz.org/topics/melanocytic-naevus,**Melanocytic naevus**,What is the outlook for melanocytic naevi? (Melanocytic nevi),"Most melanocytic naevi that appear in childhood remain forever. Teenagers and young adults tend to have the greatest number of naevi. There are fewer in later life because some of them slowly fade away.
* A patient noticing a significant change in a mole or a new lesion should show this to their doctor or dermatologist"

(Melanocytic nevi),A congenital melanocytic naevus (American spelling nevus) is a proliferation of benign melanocytes that are present at birth or develop shortly after birth. This form of a congenital naevus is also known as a brown birthmark.
Melanocytic nevi,https://dermnetnz.org/topics/congenital-melanocytic-naevi,**Congenital melanocytic naevus**,Classification of congenital melanocytic naevi (Melanocytic nevi),"Congenital melanocytic naevi are usually classified by their size in an adult. There are several different classifications.
* A small congenital melanocytic naevus is 20cm in diameter, and are further subdivided into:
* G1 (21–30 cm)
* G2 (31–40 cm)
* G3 (> 40 cm)."
Melanocytic nevi,https://dermnetnz.org/topics/congenital-melanocytic-naevi,**Congenital melanocytic naevus**,2013 Classification of congenital melanocytic naevi (Melanocytic nevi),"In 2013, a new categorisation of congenital melanocytic naevi using predicted adult size was proposed:
* Small ( 10–20 cm)
* Large (L1: > 20–30 cm, L2: > 30–40 cm)
* Giant (G1: > 40–60 cm, G2: > 60 cm)

Melanocytic nevi,https://dermnetnz.org/topics/congenital-melanocytic-naevi,**Congenital melanocytic naevus**,Progression over time (Melanocytic nevi),"Congenital melanocytic naevi usually grow proportionally with the child. As a rough guide, the likely adult size of a congenital naevus can be calculated as follows:
* Lower limbs: adult size is x 3.3 size at birth
* Upper limbs/torso: adult size is x 2.8 size at birth
* Head: adult size is x 1.7 size at birth."

Melanocytic nevi,https://dermnetnz.org/topics/congenital-melanocytic-naevi,**Congenital melanocytic naevus**,How common are congenital melanocytic naevi? (Melanocytic nevi),"* Small congenital naevi occur in 1 in 100 births
* Medium congenital naevi occur in 1 in 1000 births
* Giant congenital melanocytic naevi are much rarer (1 in 20,000 live births)

They occur in all races and ethnic groups, and males and females are at equal risk."
Melanocytic nevi,https://dermnetnz.org/topics/congenital-melanocytic-naevi,**Congenital melanocytic naevus**,What do congenital melanocytic naevi look like? (Melanocytic nevi),"Congenital melanocytic naevi present as single or multi-shaded, round or oval-shaped pigmented patches. They may have increased hair growth (hypertrichosis). The surface may be slightly rough or bumpy.
Congenital naevi usually enlarge as the child grows but they may sometimes become smaller and less obvious with time. Rarely some may even disappear. However, they may also become darker, raised, more bumpy and hairy, particularly around the time of puberty."
Melanocytic nevi,https://dermnetnz.org/topics/congenital-melanocytic-naevi,**Congenital melanocytic naevus**,Do congenital melanocytic naevi cause any symptoms? (Melanocytic nevi),"Congenital melanocytic naevi are usually asymptomatic, however, some may be itchy, particularly larger lesions. It is thought there may be a reduced function of sebaceous (oil) and eccrine (sweat) glands, which may result in skin dryness and a heightened sensation of itch.
The overlying skin may become fragile and erode or ulcerate. Deep nests of melanocytes in the dermis may weaken the bonds between the epidermis and the dermis and account for skin fragility .
Congenital melanocytic naevi are often unsightly, especially when extensive, ie large or giant congenital melanocytic naevi. They may, therefore, result in anxiety and impaired self-image, especially when the lesions are in visible areas.
Giant melanocytic naevi, and to a lesser degree small lesions, are associated with increased risk of developing cutaneous melanoma, neurocutaneous melanoma and rarely other tumours (see below)."
Melanocytic nevi,https://dermnetnz.org/topics/congenital-melanocytic-naevi,**Congenital melanocytic naevus**,What causes a congenital melanocytic naevus? (Melanocytic nevi),"Congenital melanocytic naevi are caused by localised genetic abnormalities resulting in the proliferation of melanocytes; these are cells in the skin responsible for normal skin colour. This abnormal proliferation is thought to occur between the 5th and 24th weeks of gestation. If proliferation starts early in development, giant and medium-sized congenital melanocytic naevi are formed. Smaller congenital melanocytic naevi are formed later in development after the melanoblasts (immature melanocytes) have migrated from the neural crest to the skin.
Very early onset of congenital naevus before the separation of the upper and lower eyelids results in kissing naevi, ie one part of the naevus is on the upper lid and the other part is on the lower eyelid.

Melanocytic nevi,https://dermnetnz.org/topics/congenital-melanocytic-naevi,**Congenital melanocytic naevus**,Molecular changes (Melanocytic nevi),"Proto-oncogenes c-met and c-kit have important roles in the development of melanocytes. Hepatocyte growth factor, a cytokine (messenger protein) that regulates the proliferation and migration of melanocytes, may also be important in the development of congenital melanocytic naevi."
Melanocytic nevi,https://dermnetnz.org/topics/congenital-melanocytic-naevi,**Congenital melanocytic naevus**,Neurocutaneous melanosis (Melanocytic nevi),"The estimated risk of NCM developing in individuals with large and giant congenital melanocytic naevus (CMN) is 10–33%. However, it is likely that the majority of cases remain asymptomatic, and the true incidence remains unknown. The melanocytes in the brain and spinal cord may often be detected by an MRI scan.
Neurocutaneous melanocytosis may present with symptoms of raised intracranial pressure, such as:
* A headache
* Vomiting
* Irritability
* Focal cranial nerve signs
* Seizures
* Hydrocephalus
* Delayed development."
Melanocytic nevi,https://dermnetnz.org/topics/congenital-melanocytic-naevi,**Congenital melanocytic naevus**,Pathology (Melanocytic nevi),"Congenital melanocytic naevi are usually larger than acquired naevi (which are melanocytic naevi that appear after 2 years of age), and the naevus cells often extend deeper into the dermis, fat layer, and deeper structures. The naevus cells characteristically cluster around blood vessels, hair follicles, sebaceous and eccrine glands, and other skin structures. Congenital naevus cells tend to involve collagen bundles in the deeper layers of the skin more than is the case in an acquired naevus."
Melanocytic nevi,https://dermnetnz.org/topics/congenital-melanocytic-naevi,**Congenital melanocytic naevus**,Risk of developing melanoma within a congenital melanocytic naevus (Melanocytic nevi),"* Large or giant size
* Axial or paravertebral location (crossing the spine)
* Multiple congenital satellite naevi
* Neurocutaneous melanosis.

The risk of melanoma is mainly related to the size of the congenital melanocytic naevus. Small and medium-sized congenital melanocytic naevi have a very small risk, well under 1%. Melanoma is more likely to develop in giant congenital naevi (lifetime estimates are 5–10% but may be overestimates). A review of 27 studies including over 11,000 patients with congenital naevi, the prevalence of melanoma was 1.84 overall, and 2.73% in those with large congenital naevi. Melanoma can start deep inside the naevus or within any neuromelanosis found in the brain and spinal cord. Very rarely, other tissues that contain melanocytes may also be a source of melanoma such as the gastrointestinal tract mucosa. In 24% of cases, the origin of the melanoma cannot be identified.
Melanoma associated with a giant congenital melanocytic naevus or neuromelanosis can be very difficult to detect and treat.
The risk of development of melanoma is greater in early childhood; 70% of melanomas associated with giant congenital melanocytic naevi are diagnosed by the age of ten years.
Melanoma can also develop within a small congenital melanocytic naevus. This is rare and likely to occur on the periphery of the naevus during adult life."

* It is advisable to continue neurodevelopmental observation in those at risk of neurocutaneous melanosis."
Melanocytic nevi,https://dermnetnz.org/topics/congenital-melanocytic-naevi,**Congenital melanocytic naevus**,Prognosis of melanoma associated with congenital melanocytic naevus (Melanocytic nevi),"Unfortunately, when a rare melanoma arises within a giant congenital melanocytic naevus, the prognosis is unfavourable. This is due to the deeper origin of the tumour rendering it more difficult to detect on clinical examination, resulting in a later stage at presentation. The deeper location also facilitates earlier spread through blood and lymph vessels. In 24% of cases, the melanoma has already spread to other sites (metastases) at the time of the first diagnosis."
Melanocytic nevi,https://dermnetnz.org/topics/congenital-melanocytic-naevi,**Congenital melanocytic naevus**,Treatment of a congenital melanocytic naevus (Melanocytic nevi),"Management of a congenital melanocytic naevus must take into account the age of the subject, the lesion size, the location and depth, and the risk of developing malignant change within the lesion."
Melanocytic nevi,https://dermnetnz.org/topics/congenital-melanocytic-naevi,**Congenital melanocytic naevus**,Giant congenital melanocytic naevus (Melanocytic nevi),The only definite indication for surgery in a giant congenital melanocytic naevus is when melanoma develops within it.
Melanocytic nevi,https://dermnetnz.org/topics/congenital-melanocytic-naevi,**Congenital melanocytic naevus**,Small congenital naevus (Melanocytic nevi),"If a small congenital naevus is growing at the same rate as the child and is not changing in any other way, the usual practice is not to remove it until the child is old enough to co-operate with a local anaesthetic injection, usually around the age of 10 to 12 years. Even then, removal is not essential.
Reasons to consider surgical removal may include:
* Unsightly appearance
* Difficulty in observing the mole (eg, scalp, back)
* A recent change in the lesion (darkening, lumpiness, increasing size)
* Melanoma-like appearance (irregular shape, variegated colour)."
Melanocytic nevi,https://dermnetnz.org/topics/congenital-melanocytic-naevi,**Congenital melanocytic naevus**,Prophylactic surgical removal of a naevus (Melanocytic nevi),"The following factors should be considered prior to prophylactic surgical removal of a naevus.
* Prophylactic excision of a small lesion may be delayed until an age when the patient is old enough to make an informed choice.
* Small or medium-sized congenital melanocytic naevi are at low risk for developing malignant change.
* Irregular, lumpy or thick lesions or lesions that are difficult to clinically assess may have a lower threshold for consideration of surgical excision, so as not to miss a melanoma.
* 50% of melanomas diagnosed in those with giant congenital melanocytic naevi occur at another body site such as within the central nervous system. Therefore surgical excision of the lesion may not eliminate the risk of melanoma.
* Large or giant melanocytic lesions may be too large to excise completely."
Melanocytic nevi,https://dermnetnz.org/topics/congenital-melanocytic-naevi,**Congenital melanocytic naevus**,Complications of surgery (Melanocytic nevi),"Complications that may occur after surgery include:
* Graft or flap failure

Melanocytic nevi,https://medlineplus.gov/moles.html,Moles,Summary (Melanocytic nevi),"Moles are growths on the skin. They happen when pigment cells in the skin, called melanocytes, grow in clusters. Moles are very common. Most people have between 10 and 40 moles. A person may develop new moles from time to time, usually until about age 40. In older people, they tend to fade away.
Moles are usually pink, tan or brown. They can be flat or raised. They are usually round or oval and no larger than a pencil eraser.

Melanocytes are cells that make the pigment that gives skin its color. The pigment is called melanin. This illustration shows melanoma cells extending from the surface of the skin into the deeper skin layers.
Melanoma is a kind of skin cancer that starts in the melanocytes. Melanocytes are cells that make the pigment that gives skin its color. The pigment is called melanin.
Melanoma typically starts on skin that's often exposed to the sun. This includes the skin on the arms, back, face and legs. Melanoma also can form in the eyes. Rarely, it can happen inside the body, such as in the nose or throat.
The exact cause of all melanomas isn't clear. Most melanomas are caused by exposure to ultraviolet light. Ultraviolet light, also called UV light, comes from sunlight or tanning lamps and beds. Limiting exposure to UV light can help reduce the risk of melanoma.
The risk of melanoma seems to be increasing in people under 40, especially women. Knowing the symptoms of skin cancer can help ensure that cancerous changes are detected and treated before the cancer has spread. Melanoma can be treated successfully if it is found early."

* The development of a new pigmented or unusual-looking growth on the skin.

Melanoma doesn't always begin as a mole. It also can happen on otherwise healthy skin.
Melanomas symptoms can happen anywhere on the body. Melanomas most often develop in areas that have had exposure to the sun. This includes the arms, back, face and legs.
Melanomas also can happen in areas that aren't as exposed to the sun. This includes the soles of the feet, palms of the hands and fingernail beds. Melanoma also can happen inside the body. These hidden melanomas are more common in people with brown or Black skin."

They may have certain characteristics that indicate melanomas or other skin cancers. Characteristics may include:
* **Asymmetrical shape.** Look for moles with unusual shapes, such as two very different-looking halves.
* **Changes in color.** Look for growths that have many colors or unusual color patterns.
* **Changes in size.** Look for new growth in a mole larger than 1/4 inch (about 6 millimeters).
* **Changes in symptoms.** Look for changes in symptoms, such as new itchiness or bleeding.
* **Unusual border.** Look for moles with unusual, notched or scalloped borders.

Moles that become cancers can all look very different. Some may show all of the changes listed above, while others may have only one or two unusual characteristics."

These areas may include the spaces between the toes and on the palms, soles, scalp or genitals. These are sometimes referred to as hidden melanomas because they occur in places most people wouldn't think to check. When melanoma occurs in people with brown or Black skin, it's more likely to occur in a hidden area.
Hidden melanomas include:
* **Melanoma inside the body.** Mucosal melanoma develops in the mucous membrane. This tissue lines the nose, mouth, esophagus, anus, urinary tract and vagina. Mucosal melanomas are especially difficult to detect because they can easily be mistaken for other far more common conditions.
* **Melanoma in the eye.** Eye melanoma also is called ocular melanoma. It most often occurs in the layer of tissue beneath the white of the eye. This layer is called the uvea. An eye melanoma may cause vision changes and may be diagnosed during an eye exam.
* **Melanoma under a nail.** Acral-lentiginous melanoma is a rare form of melanoma that can occur under a fingernail or toenail. It also can be found on the palms of the hands or the soles of the feet. Acral-lentiginous melanoma tends to be very dark, flat and have very unusual borders. It's more common in people of Asian descent and people with brown or Black skin."

One type of skin cancer called basal cell carcinoma begins in the basal cells. Basal cells make skin cells that keep pushing older cells toward the surface. As new cells move up, they become squamous cells. Skin cancer that starts in the squamous cells is called squamous cell carcinoma of the skin. Melanoma, another type of skin cancer, happens in the pigment cells, called melanocytes.
Melanoma happens when something changes healthy melanocytes into cancer cells. Melanocytes are skin cells that make pigment that gives skin its color. The pigment is called melanin.
Melanoma starts when melanocytes develop changes in their DNA. A cell's DNA holds the instructions that tell a cell what to do. In healthy cells, DNA gives instructions to grow and multiply at a set rate. The instructions tell the cells to die at a set time. In cancer cells, the DNA changes give different instructions. The changes tell the cancer cells to make many more cells quickly. Cancer cells can keep living when healthy cells would die. This causes too many cells.
The cancer cells might form a mass called a tumor. The tumor can grow to invade and destroy healthy body tissue. In time, cancer cells can break away and spread to other parts of the body. When cancer spreads, it's called metastatic cancer.
It isn't clear what changes the DNA in skin cells and how it leads to melanoma. It's likely a combination of factors, including environmental and genetic factors. Still, healthcare professionals believe exposure to ultraviolet light is the leading cause of melanoma. Ultraviolet light, also called UV light, comes from the sun and from tanning lamps and beds.
UV light doesn't cause all melanomas, especially those that occur in places on your body that don't receive exposure to sunlight. This means that other factors may contribute to your risk of melanoma."
Melanoma,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/melanoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20374884,[Melanoma](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/melanoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20374884),Risk factors (Melanoma),"Factors that may increase the risk of melanoma include:
* **A family history of melanoma.** If a close relative has had melanoma, you have a greater chance of developing a melanoma, too. Close relatives may include a parent, child or sibling.
* **A history of sunburn.** One or more severe, blistering sunburns can increase your risk of melanoma.
* **Exposure to UV light.** The ultraviolet light, also called UV light, that comes from the sun and from tanning lights and beds increases the risk of skin cancer, including melanoma.
* **Having many moles or moles that aren't typical.** Having more than 50 typical moles on your body indicates an increased risk of melanoma. Also, having a type of mole that isn't typical increases the risk of melanoma. Known medically as dysplastic nevi, these moles tend to be larger than typical moles. They may have unusual borders and a mixture of colors.
* **Living closer to the equator or at a higher elevation.** People living closer to the earth's equator experience more direct sun rays. Therefore, they experience higher amounts of UV light from the sun than people living farther north or south. Also, people who live at a higher elevation are more exposed to UV light.
* **Skin that sunburns easily.** Anyone can get melanoma, but it's most common in people with white skin. If you have blond or red hair, light-colored eyes, and freckle or sunburn easily, you're more likely to develop melanoma.
* **Weakened immune system.** If the body's germ-fighting immune system is weakened by medications or illness, there might be a higher risk of melanoma and other skin cancers. People with a weakened immune system include those taking medicines to control the immune system, such as after an organ transplant. Certain medical conditions, such as infection with HIV, can weaken the immune system."
Melanoma,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/melanoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20374884,[Melanoma](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/melanoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20374884),Prevention (Melanoma),"You can reduce your risk of melanoma and other types of skin cancer if you:
* **Avoid tanning lamps and beds.** Tanning lamps and beds give off ultraviolet light, also called UV light. Exposure to this kind of light can increase your risk of skin cancer.
* **Avoid the sun during the middle of the day.** For many people in North America, the sun's rays are strongest between about 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. Schedule outdoor activities for other times of the day, even in winter or when the sky is cloudy.
* **Become familiar with your skin so that you'll notice changes.** Check your skin often for new skin growths. Look for changes in existing moles, freckles, bumps and birthmarks. With the help of mirrors, check your face, neck, ears and scalp.
Look at your chest and trunk and the tops and undersides of your arms and hands. Check both the front and back of your legs and your feet, including the soles and the spaces between your toes. Also check your genital area and between your buttocks.
* **Wear protective clothing.** When you go outside during the day, wear clothes that help protect your skin from the sun's rays. Cover your skin with dark, tightly woven clothing that covers your arms and legs. Wear a broad-brimmed hat, which provides more protection than does a baseball cap or visor. Some companies also sell protective clothing. A dermatologist can recommend an appropriate brand.
Don't forget sunglasses. Look for those that block both types of UV light that come from the sun, called UVA and UVB.
* **Wear sunscreen year-round.** Use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30, even on cloudy days. Apply sunscreen generously. Reapply every two hours, or more often if you're swimming or sweating.

What type of biopsy procedure is used depends on your situation. Most often healthcare professionals recommend removing the entire growth when possible.
One common technique is called the punch biopsy. A punch biopsy is done with a circular blade that's pressed into the skin around the suspicious mole.
Another technique is called an excisional biopsy. An excisional biopsy uses a scalpel to cut away the entire mole and some of the healthy tissue around it."

A very thin melanoma may be removed entirely during the biopsy and require no further treatment. Otherwise, your surgeon will remove the cancer as well as some of the healthy tissue around it.
For people with melanomas that are small and thin, surgery might be the only treatment needed. If the melanoma has grown deeper into the skin, there might be a risk that the cancer has spread. So other treatments are often used to make sure all the cancer cells are killed.
If the melanoma has grown deeper into the skin or if it may have spread to the nearby lymph nodes, surgery might be used to remove the lymph nodes."

The energy can come from X-rays, protons or other sources. During radiation therapy, you lie on a table while a machine moves around you. The machine directs radiation to precise points on your body.
Radiation therapy may be directed to the lymph nodes if the melanoma has spread there. Radiation therapy also can be used to treat melanomas that can't be removed completely with surgery. For melanoma that spreads to other areas of the body, radiation therapy can help relieve symptoms."

The immune system fights off diseases by attacking germs and other cells that shouldn't be in the body. Cancer cells survive by hiding from the immune system. Immunotherapy helps the immune system cells find and kill the cancer cells.
For melanoma, immunotherapy may be used after surgery for cancer that has spread to the lymph nodes or to other areas of the body. When melanoma can't be removed completely with surgery, immunotherapy treatments might be injected directly into the melanoma."

By blocking these chemicals, targeted treatments can cause cancer cells to die.
For melanoma, targeted therapy might be recommended if the cancer has spread to your lymph nodes or to other areas of your body. Cells from your melanoma may be tested to see if targeted therapy is likely to be effective against your cancer."

Many chemotherapy medicines exist. Most are given through a vein. Some come in pill form.
Chemotherapy might be an option to help control melanoma that doesn't respond to other treatments. It might be used when immunotherapy or targeted therapy aren't helping.
Sometimes chemotherapy can be given in a vein in your arm or leg in a procedure called isolated limb perfusion. During this procedure, blood in your arm or leg isn't allowed to travel to other areas of your body for a short time.

* **Write down symptoms you're experiencing,** including any that may not seem related to the reason for which you scheduled the appointment.
* **Write down key personal information,** including major stresses or recent life changes.
* **Make a list of all medicines,** vitamins or supplements you're taking and the doses.
* **Take a family member or friend along.** Sometimes it can be difficult to remember all the information provided during an appointment. Someone who accompanies you may remember something that you missed or forgot.
* **Write down questions to ask** your healthcare team.

Your time with your healthcare team is limited, so prepare a list of questions to help you make the most of your time together. List your questions from most important to least important in case time runs out. For melanoma, some basic questions to ask include:
* Do I have melanoma?
* How large is my melanoma?
* How deep is my melanoma?
* Has my melanoma spread beyond the area of skin where it was first discovered?
* What additional tests do I need?
* What are my treatment options?
* Can any treatment cure my melanoma?
* What are the potential side effects of each treatment option?
* Is there one treatment you feel is best for me?
* How long can I take to decide on a treatment option?
* Should I see a specialist? What will that cost, and will my insurance cover it?
* Are there any brochures or other printed material that I can take with me? What websites do you recommend?
* What will determine whether I should plan for a follow-up visit?

Don't hesitate to ask other questions.

Melanoma,https://dermnetnz.org/topics/melanoma,**Melanoma**,What is melanoma?,"Melanoma, also referred to as malignant melanoma, is a potentially very serious skin cancer in which there is an uncontrolled growth of melanocytes (pigment cells).
* Invasive, if a tumour has spread into the dermis

Superficial spreading malignant melanoma - irregular border, variable pigmentation, and areas of clinical regression
Superficial spreading malignant melanoma - an enlarging pigmented lesion with variable pigmentation, irregular edge, and asymmetry
Acral lentiginous malignant melanoma - irregular edge, with variable pigmentation, asymmetry and areas of regression on the heel
Nodular malignant melanoma in a vertical growth phase - rapidly enlarging scaly pigmented nodule
Irregular pigmented longitudinal bands in melanoma of the nail unit
Amelanotic melanoma arising within pigmented melanoma
Amelanotic subungal melanoma - a red lesion arising from the nail fold that has produced destruction of the nail plate
Multiple blue nodules of cutaneous metastatic malignant melanoma
A superficial malignant melanoma - irregular and notched margin, variable and irregular pigmentation in an itchy and enlarging pigmented lesion
For more images, please see links at the bottom of the page."
Melanoma,https://dermnetnz.org/topics/melanoma,**Melanoma**,Who gets melanoma?,"Australia and New Zealand have the highest reported incidence and mortality of melanoma globally. About 1 in 15-18 white-skinned Australians and New Zealanders are expected to develop melanoma in their lifetime. Melanoma is the third most common cancer in Australia and New Zealand.
In 2019, there were 2,727 melanoma registrations in New Zealand. There were 362 deaths from melanoma in 2016.
Melanoma can occur in adults of any age but is very rare in children. According to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, in 2021:
* 7.9% of people diagnosed with melanoma were aged under 40 years
* 10.7% were aged 40-49
* 17.8% were aged 50-59
* 23.9% were aged 60-69
* 23.7% were aged 70-79
* 16% were aged 80 or older.

The mean age for melanoma diagnosis is 65.7 years among men and 62.4 years among women. Melanoma is the most common cancer diagnosed in young Australians aged 15–29 years, accounting for 15% of all cancers in this age group.
* Increasing age
* A strong family history of melanoma with two or more first-degree relatives affected
* White/fair skin
* Parkinson disease
* UV exposure
* Weakened immune system or cancer-prone syndromes.

These risk factors are not as relevant to rarer types of melanoma.
Although the presence of a large number of common nevi is a strong risk factor for cutaneous melanoma, the majority of melanomas arise de novo. A 2017 meta-analysis of 38 studies including over 20,000 melanomas found that only 29 percent were nevus-associated, with the rest arising de novo."
Melanoma,https://dermnetnz.org/topics/melanoma,**Melanoma**,Conventional classification (Melanoma),"The more traditional morphologic classification by histopathology of melanoma, includes the subtypes:

Less common variants include:

Combinations may also occur, for example, nodular melanoma arising within a superficial spreading melanoma.
Melanoma is usually epithelial in origin ie, starting in the skin or, less often, mucous membranes. However, very rarely, melanoma can start in an internal tissue such as the brain (primary CNS melanoma) or the back of the eye."
Melanoma,https://dermnetnz.org/topics/melanoma,**Melanoma**,Classification by age (Melanoma),Melanoma can also be classified according to its relationship with age.
Melanoma,https://dermnetnz.org/topics/melanoma,**Melanoma**,Childhood melanomas (< 10 years of age),"* Extremely rare ( 40 cm diameter
* Often spitzoid melanoma type lacking conventional ABCD features (see below)"
Melanoma,https://dermnetnz.org/topics/melanoma,**Melanoma**,Early-onset melanomas,"* More common in women than men
* Associated with many melanocytic naevi
* Tend to be seen on the lower extremity
* Tend to have a BRAF V600E genetic mutation
* Associated with intermittent sun exposure"
Melanoma,https://dermnetnz.org/topics/melanoma,**Melanoma**,Late-onset melanomas,"* More common in men than in women
* Often occur on the head and neck
* Associated with accumulated lifelong sun exposure"
Melanoma,https://dermnetnz.org/topics/melanoma,**Melanoma**,What are the clinical features of melanoma?,"Melanomas can occur anywhere on the body, not only in areas that get a lot of sun. In New Zealand, the most common site in men is the back (around 40% of melanomas in men), and the most common site in women is the leg (around 35% of melanomas in women).
Melanoma may be detected at an early stage when it is only a few millimetres in diameter, but it may grow to several centimetres in diameter before it is diagnosed.
A melanoma may have a variety of colours including:
* Tan, dark brown, black, blue, red and, occasionally, light grey.
* Melanomas that are lacking pigment are called amelanotic melanoma.
* There may be areas of regression that are the colour of normal skin, or white and scarred.

During its horizontal phase of growth, a melanoma is normally flat. As the vertical phase develops, the melanoma becomes thickened, raised, and palpable.
Some melanomas are itchy or tender. More advanced lesions may bleed easily or crust over.
Most melanomas have characteristics described by the ABCDE+EFG melanoma criteria or the Glasgow 7-point checklist."
Melanoma,https://dermnetnz.org/topics/melanoma,**Melanoma**,The ABCDEFG of Melanoma,"A: **A** symmetry of shape and colour B: **B** order irregularity, including smudgy or ill-defined margin C: **C** olour variation and change D: **D** ifferent (formerly diameter) E: **E** volving (enlarging, changing)
Melanomas may not conform to the 'ABCD' rule alone. For nodular melanomas, also consider the EFG signs
E: **E** levated F: **F** irm to touch G: **G** rowing
Taking a thorough history is important, and any lesion that changes in size, shape, colour, or elevation for more than one month should be reviewed by a dermatologist or biopsied."

* Oozing
* Change in sensation"
Melanoma,https://dermnetnz.org/topics/melanoma,**Melanoma**,How do clinical features vary in differing types of skin? (Melanoma),"White or pale skin colour is an independent but significant risk factor for melanoma across diverse ethnic groups. However, people of all skin colours with a family history of melanoma are at increased risk of developing melanoma due to a genetic predisposition.
In skin of colour, it can be harder to identify melanomas, their growth phase, and their pattern as the surrounding skin may mask or match the colour of the melanoma.
People with skin of colour tend to have:
* Thicker melanomas at diagnosis and higher mortality rates"
Melanoma,https://dermnetnz.org/topics/melanoma,**Melanoma**,What are the complications of melanoma?,"* Side effects from systemic or radiation therapy
* Death

Complications due to surgery:
* Wound infection
* Inability to close
* Dehiscence
* Skin necrosis
* Incomplete resection
* Seromas, lymphoedema, and lymphoceles with node dissection."
Melanoma,https://dermnetnz.org/topics/melanoma,**Melanoma**,How is melanoma diagnosed?,Melanoma may be suspected because of a lesion's clinical features or a history of change.
Melanoma,https://dermnetnz.org/topics/melanoma,**Melanoma**,Biopsy (Melanoma),"Histopathology is required for the definitive diagnosis of melanoma.
If there is invasive melanoma, the pathologist will comment on:
* Diagnosis of primary melanoma
* Breslow thickness—the Breslow thickness is reported for invasive melanomas to the nearest 0.1 mm. It is measured vertically in millimetres from the top of the granular layer (or base of superficial ulceration) to the deepest point of tumour involvement. It is a strong predictor of outcome; the thicker the melanoma, the more likely it is to metastasise (spread).
* Clark level of invasion—indicates the anatomic plane of invasion. Deeper Clark levels have a greater risk of metastasis. It is useful in predicting the outcome of thin tumours. It is less useful than Breslow thickness for thick tumours.
* Level 1: In situ melanoma
* Level 2: Melanoma has invaded the papillary dermis
* Level 3: Melanoma has filled the papillary dermis
* Level 4: Melanoma has invaded the reticular dermis
* Level 5: Melanoma has invaded the subcutaneous tissue
* Margins of excision—the normal tissue around a tumour
* Mitotic rate—a measure of how fast the cells are proliferating
* Presence of ulceration.

The report may also include comments about the cell type, growth pattern, invasion of blood vessels or nerves, inflammatory response, regression, associated in-situ disease and any associated naevus (original mole)."
Melanoma,https://dermnetnz.org/topics/melanoma,**Melanoma**,Staging (Melanoma),"Melanoma staging means finding out if the melanoma has spread from its original site in the skin. Most melanoma specialists refer to the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) cutaneous melanoma staging guidelines (8th edition, 2018). In summary, the stages are:
Stage | Characteristics
---|---
Stage 0 | In situ melanoma
Stage 1 | Thin melanoma 2 mm in thickness
Stage 2 | Thick melanoma > 2 mm in thickness, or > 1mm thickness with ulceration
Stage 3 | Melanoma spread to involve local lymph nodes
Stage 4 | Distant metastases have been detected"
Melanoma,https://dermnetnz.org/topics/melanoma,**Melanoma**,Wide local excision (Melanoma),"Margins recommended in New Zealand (2013):
* Melanoma in situ: 5–10 mm
* Melanoma  2 mm: 20 mm

Australian Clinical Practice Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of melanoma (updated 2018), recommend, where possible:
* Melanoma in situ: 5 mm, and wider margins if appropriate
* Melanoma  4 mm: 20 mm"
Melanoma,https://dermnetnz.org/topics/melanoma,**Melanoma**,Systemic therapy (Melanoma),"If the melanoma is widespread, surgical treatment is not always successful in eradicating cancer. Some patients may be offered new or experimental treatments. Currently, there are two main types of drug therapy used to treat melanoma:
* Combination BRAF and MEK inhibitors: dabrafenib
* Immunotherapy/immune-modulating therapy
* PD-L1: atezolizumab
* LAG-3 inhibitor: relatlimab
* Chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy (CAR-T)

Chemotherapy is rarely used in Australia and New Zealand for melanoma management."
Melanoma,https://dermnetnz.org/topics/melanoma,**Melanoma**,Radiation therapy (Melanoma),"Radiation therapy should be considered in patients with a single or small number of brain metastases, painful bone metastases, problematic skin, soft tissue or nodal metastases that have not responded to systemic therapy. This may help relieve symptoms from the metastases."
Melanoma,https://dermnetnz.org/topics/melanoma,**Melanoma**,What is the outcome of melanoma?,"Melanoma in situ is cured by excision because it has no potential to spread around the body.
The risk of spread and ultimate death from invasive melanoma depends on several factors, including anatomic location, pathologic factors, and mutation status. However, the main factor is the Breslow thickness of the melanoma at the time it was surgically removed.
Metastases are rare for melanomas  4 mm have a risk of metastasis of about 40%.

Melanoma,https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/14391-melanoma,Melanoma,Overview (Melanoma),Learn the ABCDE rule for identifying melanoma.
Melanoma,https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/14391-melanoma,Melanoma,What is melanoma?,"Melanoma comes from skin cells called melanocytes. These cells produce melanin, the dark pigment that gives skin its color. Most melanomas are black or brown in color, but some are pink, red, purple or skin-colored."
Melanoma,https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/14391-melanoma,Melanoma,How common is melanoma?,"Melanoma accounts for only about 1% of all skin cancers, but causes the great majority of skin cancer-related deaths. It’s one of the most common cancers in young people under 30, especially in young women.
Melanoma incidence has dramatically increased over the past 30 years. It’s widely accepted that increasing levels of ultraviolet (UV) exposure are one of the main reasons for this rapid rise in the number of melanoma cases."
Melanoma,https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/14391-melanoma,Melanoma,Where can I get melanoma on my body?,You can get melanoma on any area of your body. Melanoma can even form on your eyes and internal organs. Men are more prone to develop melanoma on their trunk — often the upper back. Women are more likely to have melanoma on their legs.
Melanoma,https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/14391-melanoma,Melanoma,What are the signs of melanoma?,"Knowing how to spot melanoma is important because early melanomas are highly treatable. Melanoma can appear as moles, scaly patches, open sores or raised bumps.
* **A** symmetry: One half does not match the other half.
* **B** order: The edges are not smooth.
* **C** olor: The color is mottled and uneven, with shades of brown, black, gray, red or white.
* **D** iameter: The spot is greater than the tip of a pencil eraser (6.0 mm).
* **E** volving: The spot is new or changing in size, shape or color.

Some melanomas don't fit the ABCDE rule, so tell your doctor about any sores that won't go away, unusual bumps or rashes or changes in your skin or in any existing moles.
Another tool to recognize melanoma is the ugly duckling sign. If one of your moles looks different from the others, it’s the ugly duckling and should be seen by a dermatologist."
Melanoma,https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/14391-melanoma,Melanoma,What causes melanoma?,"UV radiation from tanning beds also increases the risk of melanoma and has been designated as a carcinogen (cancer-causing) by the World Health Organization. Tanning bed use may be related to over over 6,000 cases of melanoma per year in the United States.
Although anyone can develop melanoma, an increased risk for developing the disease is seen in people with:
* A personal history of melanoma.
* A family history of melanoma.
* Fair skin, freckles, blond or red hair and blue eyes.
* Excess sun exposure, including blistering sunburns.
* An address near the equator or in high elevations — living in these locations may increase your UV exposure.
* A history of tanning bed use.
* A weakened immune system.

Melanoma is more common in white people, but it can occur in people of all skin types. People with darker skin most often get melanoma on their palms, soles and nails."
Melanoma,https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/14391-melanoma,Melanoma,What tests are used to stage melanoma?,"There are several tests your doctor can use to stage your melanoma. Your doctor may use these tests:
* **Blood work:** Blood tests may be used to measure lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) before treatment. Other tests include blood chemistry levels and blood cell counts."
Melanoma,https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/14391-melanoma,Melanoma,Can melanoma be prevented?,"* Avoid sun and seek shade, especially between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m.
* Don’t use tanning beds. Use a spray tan (cosmetic) instead.
* Whenever possible, wear hats with brims, sunglasses, long-sleeved shirts and pants.
* Use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with a skin protection factor (SPF) of 30 or higher and reapply often, usually every 1.5 hours or more often if you’re swimming or sweating.
* Use a lip balm with sunscreen.
* Don't forget to apply sunscreen to young children and infants older than 6 months."
Melanoma,https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/14391-melanoma,Melanoma,What is the outlook for people with melanoma?,"Most skin cancers can be cured if they’re treated before they have a chance to spread. However, more advanced cases of melanoma can be fatal. The earlier skin cancer is found and removed, the better your chances for a full recovery."
Melanoma,https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/14391-melanoma,Melanoma,When should I call my doctor? (Melanoma),"You should have a skin examination by a doctor if you have any of the following:
* A personal history of skin cancer or atypical moles (nevi).
* A family history of skin cancer.
* A history of intense sun exposure as a young person and painful or blistering sunburns.
* New or numerous large moles.
* A mole that changes in size, color or shape.
* Any mole that itches, bleeds or is tender."
Melanoma,https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/14391-melanoma,Melanoma,A note from Cleveland Clinic (Melanoma),"Receiving a diagnosis of melanoma can be scary. Watch your skin and moles for any changes and seeing your doctor regularly for skin examinations, especially if you’re fair-skinned, will give you the best chances for catching melanoma early when it’s most treatable."
Melanoma,https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/15818-skin-cancer,Skin Cancer,Overview (Melanoma),Types of skin cancer and how you can recognize them.
Melanoma,https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/15818-skin-cancer,Skin Cancer,What is skin cancer? (Melanoma),"Skin cancer is a disease that involves the growth of abnormal cells in your skin tissues. Normally, as skin cells grow old and die, new cells form to replace them. When this process doesn’t work as it should — like after exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light from the sun — cells grow more quickly. These cells may be noncancerous (benign), which don’t spread or cause harm. Or they may be cancerous.
Skin cancer can spread to nearby tissue or other areas in your body if it’s not caught early. Fortunately, if skin cancer is identified and treated in early stages, most are cured. So, it’s important to talk with your healthcare provider if you think you have any signs of skin cancer."
Melanoma,https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/15818-skin-cancer,Skin Cancer,Types of skin cancer (Melanoma),"There are three main types of skin cancer:

Other types of skin cancer include:"
Melanoma,https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/15818-skin-cancer,Skin Cancer,How common is skin cancer? (Melanoma),"Skin cancer is the most common cancer diagnosed in the U.S. In fact, about 1 in 5 people develop skin cancer at some point in their life."
Melanoma,https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/15818-skin-cancer,Skin Cancer,What are the signs and symptoms of skin cancer? (Melanoma),"The most common warning sign of skin cancer is a change on your skin — typically a new growth or a change in an existing growth or mole. Skin cancer symptoms include:
* A new mole. Or a mole that changes in size, shape or color, or that bleeds.
* A pearly or waxy bump on your face, ears or neck.
* A flat, pink/red- or brown-colored patch or bump.
* Areas on your skin that look like scars.
* Sores that look crusty, have a depression in the middle or bleed often.
* A wound or sore that won’t heal, or that heals but comes back again.
* A rough, scaly lesion that might itch, bleed and become crusty."
Melanoma,https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/15818-skin-cancer,Skin Cancer,What does skin cancer look like? (Melanoma),"* **A** symmetry: Irregular shape.
* **B** order: Blurry or irregularly shaped edges.
* **C** olor: Mole with more than one color.
* **D** iameter: Larger than a pencil eraser (6 millimeters).
* **E** volution: Enlarging, changing in shape, color or size. **(This is the most important sign.)**"
Melanoma,https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/15818-skin-cancer,Skin Cancer,What are the risk factors for skin cancer? (Melanoma),"Although anyone can develop skin cancer, you’re at increased risk if you:
* Spend a considerable amount of time working or playing in the sun.
* Live in a sunny or high-altitude climate.
* Have a family history of skin cancer.
* Have had an organ transplant.
* Take medications that suppress or weaken your immune system.
* Have been exposed to UV light therapy for treating skin conditions such as eczema or psoriasis."
Melanoma,https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/15818-skin-cancer,Skin Cancer,Non-melanoma staging,"* **Stage 0:** Cancer is only in the top layer of your skin.
* **Stage I (1):** Cancer is in the top and middle layers of your skin.
* **Stage II (2):** Cancer is in the top and middle layers of your skin and moves to target your nerves or deeper layers of skin.
* **Stage III (3):** Cancer has spread beyond your skin to your lymph nodes.
* **Stage IIIV (4):** Cancer has spread to other parts of your body and your organs like your liver, lungs or brain."
Melanoma,https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/15818-skin-cancer,Skin Cancer,How is skin cancer treated? (Melanoma),"Treatment depends on the stage of cancer. Sometimes, a biopsy alone can remove all the cancer tissue if it’s small and limited to the surface of your skin. Other common skin cancer treatments, used alone or in combination, include:
* **Excisional surgery:** Your dermatologist removes the tumor and some surrounding healthy skin to be sure all the cancer is gone.
* **Curettage and electrodesiccation:** Your dermatologist uses an instrument with a sharp, looped edge to remove cancer cells as it scrapes across the tumor. Then, they use an electric needle to destroy any remaining cancer cells. Providers often use this to treat basal cell and squamous cell cancers and precancerous skin tumors."
Melanoma,https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/15818-skin-cancer,Skin Cancer,Complications/side effects of the treatment (Melanoma),"The side effects of skin cancer treatment depend on what treatments your healthcare provider think will work best for you. Chemotherapy for skin cancer can lead to nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and hair loss. Other side effects or complications of skin cancer treatment include:
* Bleeding.
* Pain and swelling.
* Scars.
* Nerve damage that results in loss of feeling.
* Skin infection.
* Regrowth of the tumor after it’s been removed.

Care at Cleveland Clinic"
Melanoma,https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/15818-skin-cancer,Skin Cancer,How can I lower my risk? (Melanoma),"Ways to protect yourself from skin cancer include:
* Wear hats with wide brims to protect your face and ears.
* Wear sunglasses to protect your eyes. Look for glasses that block both UV-B and UV-A rays.
* Use a lip balm with sunscreen.
* Avoid the sun between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m."
Melanoma,https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/15818-skin-cancer,Skin Cancer,What is the outlook for people with skin cancer? (Melanoma),"Nearly all skin cancers can be cured if they’re treated before they have a chance to spread. The earlier skin cancer is found and removed, the better your chance for a full recovery. It’s important to continue following up with your dermatologist to make sure cancer doesn’t come back. If something seems wrong, call your doctor right away.
Most skin cancer deaths are from melanoma. If you’re diagnosed with melanoma:
* The five-year survival rate is 99% if it’s detected before it spreads to your lymph nodes.
* The five-year survival rate is 66% if it has spread to nearby lymph nodes.
* The five-year survival rate is 27% if it has spread to distant lymph nodes and other organs."
Melanoma,https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/15818-skin-cancer,Skin Cancer,When should I see my healthcare provider? (Melanoma),"Make an appointment to see a healthcare provider or dermatologist as soon as you notice:
* Any changes to your skin or changes in the size, shape or color of existing moles or other skin lesions.
* The appearance of a new growth on your skin.
* A sore that doesn’t heal.
* Spots on your skin that are different from others.
* Any spots that change, itch or bleed.

Your provider will check your skin, take a biopsy (if needed), make a diagnosis and discuss treatment. Also, see a dermatologist annually for a full skin review."
Melanoma,https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/15818-skin-cancer,Skin Cancer,What questions should I ask my healthcare provider? (Melanoma),"Questions to ask your dermatologist may include:
* What type of skin cancer do I have?
* What stage is my skin cancer?
* What tests will I need?
* What’s the best treatment for my skin cancer?
* What are the side effects of that treatment?
* What are the potential complications of this cancer and the treatment for it?
* What outcome can I expect?
* Do I have an increased risk of additional skin cancers?
* How often should I be seen for follow-up checkups?"
Melanoma,https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/15818-skin-cancer,Skin Cancer,How does skin cancer become a life-threatening cancer? (Melanoma),"You may wonder how cancer on the surface of your skin becomes a life-threatening cancer. It seems logical to think you could just scrape off the skin with the cancer cells or even remove the cancerous skin lesion with a minor skin surgery and that’s all that would be needed. These techniques are successfully used if cancer is caught early.
The type of cancer cell where cancer first started — called primary cancer — determines the type of cancer. For example, if malignant melanoma metastasized to your lungs, the cancer would still be called malignant melanoma. This is how that superficial skin cancer can turn into life-threatening cancer."
Melanoma,https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/15818-skin-cancer,Skin Cancer,Why does skin cancer occur in more non-sun-exposed body areas in people of color? (Melanoma),"Scientists don’t fully know why people with darker skin tones develop cancer in non-sun-exposed areas like the palms of your hands and feet. They think that the sun is less of a factor, though. That said, dermatologists still see plenty of UV sunlight-induced melanomas and squamous cell skin cancer in people with skin tones ranging from fair to very dark."
Melanoma,https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/15818-skin-cancer,Skin Cancer,Are all moles cancerous? (Melanoma),"Most moles aren’t cancerous. Some moles are present at birth. Others develop up to about age 40. Most adults have between 10 and 40 moles.
In rare cases, a mole can turn into melanoma. If you have more than 50 moles, you have an increased chance of developing melanoma."
Melanoma,https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/15818-skin-cancer,Skin Cancer,A note from Cleveland Clinic (Melanoma),"Skin cancer can happen to anyone. What may seem like an innocent cosmetic imperfection may not be. Performing regular skin self-checks is important for everyone. But it’s especially important if you have an increased risk of skin cancer.
Your skin is the largest organ in your body. And it needs as much attention as any other health concern. Check your skin every month for any changes in skin spots or any new skin growths. Take steps to protect your skin from the sun. And don’t forget to schedule regular skin checks with your dermatologist."

Malignant melanoma arises from melanocytes in a pigmented area (eg, skin, mucous membranes, eyes, or central nervous system). Metastasis is correlated with depth of dermal invasion. With metastasis, prognosis is poor. Diagnosis is by biopsy. Wide surgical excision is the rule for operable tumors. Metastatic disease requires systemic therapy but is difficult to cure."

Melanomas vary in size, shape, and color (usually pigmented) and in their propensity to invade and metastasize. Metastasis occurs via lymphatics and blood vessels. Local metastasis results in the formation of nearby satellite papules or nodules that may or may not be pigmented. Metastasis to skin or internal organs may occur, and, occasionally, metastatic nodules or enlarged lymph nodes are discovered before the primary lesion is identified.

* Sun exposure, particularly repeated blistering sunburns
* Repeated tanning with ultraviolet A (UVA) or psoralen plus UVA (PUVA) treatments
* Nonmelanoma skin cancer
* Family and personal history of melanoma
* Light skin, freckling
* Atypical moles, particularly > 5
* Increased numbers of melanocytic nevi
* Immunosuppression
* Lentigo maligna
* Congenital melanocytic nevus > 20 cm (giant congenital nevi)
* Atypical mole syndrome (dysplastic nevus syndrome)
* Familial atypical mole–melanoma syndrome
* Germline mutations in oncogenes, including _BRCA2_
* Advanced age

Congenital Melanocytic Nevus

Patients with a personal history of melanoma have an increased risk of additional melanomas. People who have one or more first-degree relatives with a history of melanoma have an increased risk (up to 6 or 8 times) over those without a family history.
Atypical mole syndrome is the presence of large numbers of moles (eg,> 50), at least one of which is atypical and at least one of which is > 8 mm in diameter.
Familial atypical mole–melanoma syndrome is the presence of multiple atypical moles and melanoma in 2 or more first-degree relatives; such people are at markedly increased risk (25 times) of melanoma.
Melanoma is less common among people with dark skin; when it occurs in people with dark skin, the nail beds, palms, and soles are more often affected.
Although melanomas occur during pregnancy, pregnancy does not increase the likelihood that a mole will become a melanoma; moles frequently change in size and darken uniformly during pregnancy.
The very rare melanomas of childhood almost always arise in the leptomeninges or from giant congenital nevi.

Melanoma,https://www.msdmanuals.com/professional/dermatologic-disorders/cancers-of-the-skin/melanoma,Melanoma,Classification of Melanoma,There are 4 main types of melanoma and a few minor subtypes.
Melanoma,https://www.msdmanuals.com/professional/dermatologic-disorders/cancers-of-the-skin/melanoma,Melanoma,Superficial spreading melanoma,"This type accounts for 70% of melanomas. Typically asymptomatic, it occurs most commonly on women’s legs and men’s torsos.
The lesion is usually a plaque with irregular, raised, indurated, and tan or brown areas, which often have red, white, black, and blue spots or small, sometimes protuberant blue-black nodules. Small notchlike indentations of the margins may be noted, along with enlargement or color change.
Histologically, atypical melanocytes characteristically invade the dermis and epidermis. This type of melanoma most commonly has activating mutations in the _BRAF_ gene at V600.

Melanoma,https://www.msdmanuals.com/professional/dermatologic-disorders/cancers-of-the-skin/melanoma,Melanoma,Nodular melanoma,"This type accounts for 15 to 30% of melanomas. It may occur anywhere on the body as a dark, protuberant papule or a plaque that varies from pearl to gray to black. Occasionally, a lesion contains little if any pigment or may look like a vascular tumor.
Unless it ulcerates, nodular melanoma is asymptomatic, but patients usually seek advice because the lesion enlarges rapidly.
Nodular Melanoma

Melanoma,https://www.msdmanuals.com/professional/dermatologic-disorders/cancers-of-the-skin/melanoma,Melanoma,Lentigo maligna melanoma,"This type accounts for 5% of melanomas. It tends to occur in older adults. It arises from lentigo maligna (Hutchinson freckle or malignant melanoma in situ—a frecklelike tan or brown macule).
Lentigo maligna usually occurs on the face or other areas of chronic sun exposure as an asymptomatic, flat, tan or brown, irregularly shaped macule or patch with darker brown or black spots scattered irregularly on its surface. In lentigo maligna, both normal and malignant melanocytes are confined to the epidermis.
When malignant melanocytes invade the dermis, the lesion is called lentigo maligna melanoma, and the cancer may metastasize.
This type of melanoma most commonly has mutations in the _C-kit_ gene.

Incidence is probably the same regardless of skin pigmentation, but because people with dark skin infrequently develop other forms of melanoma, acral-lentiginous melanoma is the most common type among them.
Acral-lentiginous melanoma arises on palmar, plantar, and subungual skin and has a characteristic histologic picture similar to that of lentigo maligna melanoma.

It can be any of the 4 main types and is most often grouped with the minor categories of melanoma such as spitzoid melanoma, desmoplastic melanoma, neurotropic melanoma, and others.
Accounting for < 10% of melanomas, amelanotic melanomas may be pink, red, or slightly light brown and may have well-defined borders. Their appearance may suggest benign lesions, or a form of nonmelanoma skin cancer, and thereby lead to a late diagnosis and possibly a worse prognosis.

Melanoma,https://www.msdmanuals.com/professional/dermatologic-disorders/cancers-of-the-skin/melanoma,Melanoma,Diagnosis of Melanoma,"* Biopsy

Polarized light and immersion contact dermoscopy may be useful for distinguishing melanomas from benign lesions. However, biopsy and histologic evaluation should be considered if moles have certain characteristics of concern (known as the ABCDEs of melanoma):
* A: Asymmetry—asymmetric appearance
* B: Borders—irregular borders (ie, not round or oval)
* C: Color—color variation within the mole, unusual colors, or a color significantly different or darker than the patient's other moles
* D: Diameter—> 6 mm
* E: Evolution—a new mole in a patient > 30 years of age or a changing mole

Patients at risk can be taught self-examination to detect changes in existing moles and to recognize features suggesting melanoma.
Other red flags include
* Recent enlargement or change in shape
* Change in surface characteristics or consistency
* Signs of inflammation in surrounding skin, with possible bleeding, ulceration, itching, or tenderness

However, recent enlargement, darkening, ulceration, or bleeding usually indicates that the melanoma has already invaded the skin deeply.
If doubt exists, biopsy should include the full depth of the dermis and extend slightly beyond the edges of the lesion. Because earlier diagnosis can be lifesaving and features of melanoma can be variable, even slightly suspect lesions should be biopsied. Earlier diagnosis of melanoma is possible if biopsy specimens can be obtained from lesions having variegated colors (eg, brown or black with shades of red, gray, or blue), irregular elevations that are visible or palpable, and borders with angular indentations or notches.
Biopsy should be excisional for most lesions except those on anatomically sensitive or cosmetically important areas; in these cases, a broad shave biopsy can be done. For broader lesions such as lentigo maligna, representative shave biopsies from several areas can increase the diagnostic yield. By doing step sections, the pathologist can determine the maximal thickness of the melanoma. Definitive radical surgery should not precede histologic diagnosis.
Tumors, particularly if metastatic, are sometimes tested genetically for mutations, eg, to suggest treatment with vemurafenib, a Tumors, particularly if metastatic, are sometimes tested genetically for mutations, eg, to suggest treatment with vemurafenib, a _BRAF_ inhibitor, for metastatic melanomas bearing a V600 mutation in the _BRAF_ gene."
Melanoma,https://www.msdmanuals.com/professional/dermatologic-disorders/cancers-of-the-skin/melanoma,Melanoma,Staging (Melanoma),"The staging of melanoma is based on clinical and pathologic criteria and closely corresponds to the traditional tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) classification system. The staging system classifies melanomas based on local, regional, or distant disease:
* Stages I and II: Localized primary melanoma
* Stage III: Metastasis to regional lymph nodes
* Stage IV: Distant metastatic disease

Stage strongly correlates with survival. Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), a minimally invasive microstaging technique, is a major advance in the ability to stage cancers more accurately. Recommended staging studies depend on the Breslow depth (how deeply tumor cells have invaded) and histologic characteristics of the melanoma; ulceration indicates higher risk in melanomas that are  1.0–2.0 mm | Without ulceration
IIB| > 1.0–2.0 mm| With ulceration

Treatment of melanoma is primarily by surgical excision (wide local excision). Although the width of margins is debated, most experts agree that a 1-cm lateral tumor-free margin is adequate for lesions < 0.8 mm thick. In tumors < 0.8 mm thick but with ulceration, sentinel lymph node biopsy can be considered. Thicker lesions may deserve larger margins, more radical surgery, and sentinel lymph node biopsy.
Lentigo maligna melanoma and lentigo maligna are usually treated with wide local excision and, if necessary, skin grafting. Intensive radiation therapy is much less effective.
The ideal treatment of melanoma in situ is surgical excision. Sometimes this can be accomplished with staged excisions or Mohs micrographic surgery, in which tissue borders are progressively excised until specimens are tumor-free (as determined by microscopic examination during surgery). If patients decline or are not candidates for surgical therapy (eg, because of comorbidities or involvement of cosmetically important areas), imiquimod and cryotherapy can be considered.

Mucosal melanomas (especially anorectal melanomas) have a poor prognosis, although they often seem quite limited when discovered. They account for a higher proportion of melanomas in Black, Hispanic, and Asian people compared with White people.
Degree of lymphocytic infiltration, which represents reaction by the patient’s immunologic defense system, may correlate with the level of invasion and prognosis. Chances of cure are maximal when lymphocytic infiltration is limited to the most superficial lesions and decrease with deeper levels of tumor cell invasion, ulceration, and vascular or lymphatic invasion.

Malignant melanoma arises from melanocytes in a pigmented area (eg, skin, mucous membranes, eyes, or central nervous system). Metastasis is correlated with depth of dermal invasion. With metastasis, prognosis is poor. Diagnosis is by biopsy. Wide surgical excision is the rule for operable tumors. Metastatic disease requires systemic therapy but is difficult to cure."

Melanomas vary in size, shape, and color (usually pigmented) and in their propensity to invade and metastasize. Metastasis occurs via lymphatics and blood vessels. Local metastasis results in the formation of nearby satellite papules or nodules that may or may not be pigmented. Metastasis to skin or internal organs may occur, and, occasionally, metastatic nodules or enlarged lymph nodes are discovered before the primary lesion is identified.

* Sun exposure, particularly repeated blistering sunburns
* Repeated tanning with ultraviolet A (UVA) or psoralen plus UVA (PUVA) treatments
* Nonmelanoma skin cancer
* Family and personal history of melanoma
* Light skin, freckling
* Atypical moles, particularly > 5
* Increased numbers of melanocytic nevi
* Immunosuppression
* Lentigo maligna
* Congenital melanocytic nevus > 20 cm (giant congenital nevi)
* Atypical mole syndrome (dysplastic nevus syndrome)

Congenital Melanocytic Nevus

Congenital melanocytic nevus (giant congenital nevus) is a risk factor for malignant melanoma. Note the large size (> 20 cm), irregular border, and heterogeneous color.

Patients with a personal history of melanoma have an increased risk of additional melanomas. People who have one or more first-degree relatives with a history of melanoma have an increased risk (up to 6 or 8 times) over those without a family history.
Atypical mole syndrome is the presence of large numbers of moles (eg,> 50), at least one of which is atypical and at least one of which is > 8 mm in diameter.
Familial atypical mole–melanoma syndrome is the presence of multiple atypical moles and melanoma in 2 or more first-degree relatives; such people are at markedly increased risk (25 times) of melanoma.
Melanoma is less common among people with dark skin; when it occurs in people with dark skin, the nail beds, palms, and soles are more often affected.
Although melanomas occur during pregnancy, pregnancy does not increase the likelihood that a mole will become a melanoma; moles frequently change in size and darken uniformly during pregnancy.
The very rare melanomas of childhood almost always arise in the leptomeninges or from giant congenital nevi.

Melanoma,https://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/dermatologic-disorders/cancers-of-the-skin/melanoma,Melanoma,Classification of Melanoma,There are 4 main types of melanoma and a few minor subtypes.
Melanoma,https://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/dermatologic-disorders/cancers-of-the-skin/melanoma,Melanoma,Superficial spreading melanoma,"This type accounts for 70% of melanomas. Typically asymptomatic, it occurs most commonly on women’s legs and men’s torsos.
The lesion is usually a plaque with irregular, raised, indurated, and tan or brown areas, which often have red, white, black, and blue spots or small, sometimes protuberant blue-black nodules. Small notchlike indentations of the margins may be noted, along with enlargement or color change.
Histologically, atypical melanocytes characteristically invade the dermis and epidermis. This type of melanoma most commonly has activating mutations in the _BRAF_ gene at V600.

Melanoma,https://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/dermatologic-disorders/cancers-of-the-skin/melanoma,Melanoma,Nodular melanoma,"This type accounts for 15 to 30% of melanomas. It may occur anywhere on the body as a dark, protuberant papule or a plaque that varies from pearl to gray to black. Occasionally, a lesion contains little if any pigment or may look like a vascular tumor.
Unless it ulcerates, nodular melanoma is asymptomatic, but patients usually seek advice because the lesion enlarges rapidly.
Nodular Melanoma

Melanoma,https://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/dermatologic-disorders/cancers-of-the-skin/melanoma,Melanoma,Lentigo maligna melanoma,"This type accounts for 5% of melanomas. It tends to occur in older adults. It arises from lentigo maligna (Hutchinson freckle or malignant melanoma in situ—a frecklelike tan or brown macule).
Lentigo maligna usually occurs on the face or other areas of chronic sun exposure as an asymptomatic, flat, tan or brown, irregularly shaped macule or patch with darker brown or black spots scattered irregularly on its surface. In lentigo maligna, both normal and malignant melanocytes are confined to the epidermis.
When malignant melanocytes invade the dermis, the lesion is called lentigo maligna melanoma, and the cancer may metastasize.
This type of melanoma most commonly has mutations in the _C-kit_ gene.

It can be any of the 4 main types and is most often grouped with the minor categories of melanoma such as spitzoid melanoma, desmoplastic melanoma, neurotropic melanoma, and others.
Accounting for < 10% of melanomas, amelanotic melanomas may be pink, red, or slightly light brown and may have well-defined borders. Their appearance may suggest benign lesions, or a form of nonmelanoma skin cancer, and thereby lead to a late diagnosis and possibly a worse prognosis.

Polarized light and immersion contact dermoscopy may be useful for distinguishing melanomas from benign lesions. However, biopsy and histologic evaluation should be considered if moles have certain characteristics of concern (known as the ABCDEs of melanoma):
* A: Asymmetry—asymmetric appearance
* B: Borders—irregular borders (ie, not round or oval)
* C: Color—color variation within the mole, unusual colors, or a color significantly different or darker than the patient's other moles
* D: Diameter—> 6 mm
* E: Evolution—a new mole in a patient > 30 years of age or a changing mole

Patients at risk can be taught self-examination to detect changes in existing moles and to recognize features suggesting melanoma.
Other red flags include
* Recent enlargement or change in shape
* Change in surface characteristics or consistency
* Signs of inflammation in surrounding skin, with possible bleeding, ulceration, itching, or tenderness

However, recent enlargement, darkening, ulceration, or bleeding usually indicates that the melanoma has already invaded the skin deeply.
If doubt exists, biopsy should include the full depth of the dermis and extend slightly beyond the edges of the lesion. Because earlier diagnosis can be lifesaving and features of melanoma can be variable, even slightly suspect lesions should be biopsied.

Normal aging can cause some forgetfulness. It is normal to have some trouble learning new material or needing more time to remember it. But normal aging does not lead to dramatic memory loss. Such memory loss is due to other diseases.
Memory loss can be caused by many things. To determine a cause, your health care provider will ask if the problem came on suddenly or slowly.
Many areas of the brain help you create and retrieve memories. A problem in any of these areas can lead to memory loss.
Memory loss may result from a new injury to the brain, which is caused by or is present after:
* Not enough oxygen getting to the brain when your heart or breathing is stopped for too long
* Major surgery or severe illness, including brain surgery
* Sudden, temporary loss of memory (transient global amnesia) of unclear cause

Sometimes, memory loss occurs with mental health problems, such as:
* After a major, traumatic or stressful event

Memory loss may be a sign of dementia. Dementia also affects thinking, language, judgment, and behavior. Common types of dementia associated with memory loss are:
* Vascular dementia
* Lewy body dementia
* Fronto-temporal dementia
* Normal pressure hydrocephalus

Other causes of memory loss include:
* Alcohol or use of prescription or illegal drugs"
Melanoma,https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003257.htm,Memory loss,Home Care (Melanoma),"Expand Section
A person with memory loss needs a lot of support.
* It helps to show the person familiar objects, music, or and photos or play familiar music.
* It is important to write down when the person should take any medicine or do other critical tasks.
* If a person needs help with everyday tasks, or if safety or nutrition is a concern, you may want to consider extended-care facilities, such as a nursing home."
Melanoma,https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003257.htm,Memory loss,What to Expect at Your Office Visit (Melanoma),"Expand Section
Your provider will perform a physical exam and ask about the person's medical history and symptoms. This will usually include asking questions of family members and friends. For this reason, they may be interviewed in-person or by phone.
Medical history questions may include:
* Type of memory loss, such as short-term or long-term
* Time pattern, such as how long the memory loss has lasted or whether it comes and goes
* Things that triggered memory loss, such as head injury or surgery

Tests that may be done include:
* Blood tests for specific diseases that are suspected (such as low vitamin B12 or thyroid disease)
* Positron emission tomography (PET) scan
* Genetic tests

Treatment depends on the cause of memory loss. Your provider can tell you more."

Melanoma,https://www.aad.org/media/stats-melanoma,Melanoma,Q. What is melanoma?,"**A.** Melanoma, the most serious form of skin cancer, is characterized by the uncontrolled growth of pigment-producing cells. Melanoma may appear on the skin suddenly without warning but also can develop within an existing mole. The overall incidence of melanoma continues to rise. (1,2)"
Melanoma,https://www.aad.org/media/stats-melanoma,Melanoma,Q. Is melanoma a serious disease?,"**A.** Melanoma is highly treatable when detected early, but advanced melanoma can spread to the lymph nodes and internal organs, which can result in death. It is estimated that 8,430 people will die from melanoma in 2025 in the United States. (3) It is estimated that 212,200 new cases of melanoma, 107,240 noninvasive (in situ) and 104,960 invasive, will be diagnosed in the U.S. in 2025. (3)"
Melanoma,https://www.aad.org/media/stats-melanoma,Melanoma,Q. Can melanoma be cured?,"**A.** When detected in its earliest stages, melanoma is highly treatable. The average five-year survival rate for individuals whose melanoma is detected and treated before it spreads to the lymph nodes is 99%. The five-year survival rates for melanoma with regional and distant spread are 75% and 35%, respectively. (3)
Early detection is essential. Dermatologists recommend a regular self-examination of the skin to detect changes in its appearance. Changing, suspicious or unusual moles or blemishes should be examined as soon as possible. A board-certified dermatologist can make individual recommendations as to how often a person needs a skin exam from a doctor based on individual risk factors, including skin type, history of sun exposure, and family history."
Melanoma,https://www.aad.org/media/stats-melanoma,Melanoma,Q. Can melanoma be prevented?,"**A.** UV exposure is the most preventable risk factor for all skin cancers, including melanoma. Here’s how to protect your skin from the sun’s harmful UV rays:
* **Seek shade.** The sun’s rays are strongest between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. If your shadow is shorter than you are, seek shade.
* **Wear sun-protective clothing,** such as a lightweight long-sleeved shirt, pants, a wide-brimmed hat, and sunglasses with UV protection, when possible. For more effective protection, choose clothing with an ultraviolet protection factor (UPF) number on the label.
* **Apply a broad-spectrum, water-resistant sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher** to all skin not covered by clothing. Broad-spectrum sunscreen provides protection from both UVA and UVB rays.
* **Use extra caution near water, snow, and sand** because they reflect and intensify the damaging rays of the sun, which can increase your chances of sunburn.
* **Avoid tanning beds.** If you want to look tan, consider using a self-tanning product, but continue to use sunscreen with it.

Melanoma,https://www.iarc.who.int/cancer-type/skin-cancer/,Skin cancer,Introduction (Melanoma),"Summary
Skin cancers are the most common groups of cancers diagnosed worldwide, with more than 1.5 million new cases estimated in 2022. In 2022, an estimated 330 000 new cases of melanoma were diagnosed worldwide and almost 60 000 people died from the disease. There are large geographical variations in melanoma incidence rates across countries and world regions. In most world regions, melanoma occurs more frequently in men than in women."

These are rarely lethal but surgical treatment is painful and often disfiguring. The temporal trends of the incidence of non-melanoma skin cancers are difficult to determine, because reliable registration of these cancers has not been achieved. However, specific studies carried out in Australia, Canada and the United States, indicate that between the 1960s and the 1980s the prevalence of non-melanoma skin cancers increased by a factor of more than two.
The risk of non-melanoma skin cancers has been examined with respect to personal exposure, and the following conclusions can be drawn:
* Non-melanoma skin cancers are most frequent on parts of the body that are commonly exposed to the sun such as ears, face, neck and forearms. This implies that long-term, repeated UV radiation exposure is a major causal factor.
* Within some countries there is a clear relationship between increasing incidence of non-melanoma skin cancers with decreasing latitude, i.e. higher UV radiation levels."

Melanoma,https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/melanoma,[Health](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health),Overview (Melanoma),"There are three main types of skin cancer: basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma and melanoma. While melanoma is a much less common form of skin cancer, it’s more likely to spread to other parts of the body than the other two cancer types.
Melanoma starts in the melanocytes, which are the skin cells that produce melanin. Melanin gives skin its color.
Melanoma can form anywhere on the skin. Melanoma usually occurs in adults, but it may occasionally be found in children and adolescents. Men usually develop melanoma on their chest or back. Women usually get melanoma on their legs. Other common sites for melanoma include the neck and face.
In rare cases, melanoma can develop in other areas of the body. For example, it can occur in the eyes, mouth, genitals or anal region."

Melanoma,https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/280245-overview,Malignant Melanoma,Pathophysiology (Melanoma),"Melanomas have two growth phases: radial and vertical. During the radial growth phase, malignant cells grow in a radial fashion in the epidermis. With time, most melanomas progress to the vertical growth phase, in which the malignant cells invade the dermis and develop the ability to metastasize. This is usually indicated by a dermal nest larger than the largest junctional nest, a dermal nest with mitosis, or a dermal nest within reticular dermis.
Clinically, lesions are classified according to their depth, as follows:
* Thin: 1 mm or less
* Moderate: 1-4 mm
* Thick: > 4 mm"
Melanoma,https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/280245-overview,Malignant Melanoma,Histologic types of melanoma,"There are five different forms, or histologic types, of melanoma, and specific gene mutations determine behavior and response to treatment::
* Superficial spreading
* Nodular
* Acral lentiginous
* Mucosal lentiginous"
Melanoma,https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/280245-overview,Malignant Melanoma,Superficial spreading melanomas,"Approximately 70% of cutaneous malignant melanomas are the superficial spreading melanoma (SSM) type. Many SSMs arise from a pigmented dysplastic nevus, often one that has long been stable. Typical changes include ulceration, enlargement, or color changes. An SSM may be found on any body surface, especially the head, neck, and trunk of males and the lower extremities of females."
Melanoma,https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/280245-overview,Malignant Melanoma,Nodular melanomas,"Nodular melanomas (NMs) represent approximately 10-15% of melanomas and also are found commonly on all body surfaces, especially the trunk of males. These lesions are the most symmetrical and uniform of the melanomas and are dark brown or black. The radial growth phase may not be evident in NMs; however, if this phase is evident, it is short-lived, because the tumor advances rapidly to the vertical growth phase, thus making the NM a high-risk lesion. Approximately 5% of all NMs are amelanotic melanomas."
Melanoma,https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/280245-overview,Malignant Melanoma,Acral lentiginous melanomas,"Acral lentiginous melanomas (ALMs) are the only melanomas that have an equal frequency in Blacks and Whites. They occur on the palms, soles, and subungual areas. Subungual melanomas often are mistaken for subungual hematomas (splinter hemorrhages). Like NM, ALM is extremely aggressive, with rapid progression from the radial to vertical growth phase."
Melanoma,https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/280245-overview,Malignant Melanoma,Genetics (Melanoma),"Many genes are implicated in the development of melanoma, including _TERT_ , _CDKN2A (p16), CDK4, RB1, CDKN2A (p19), PTEN/MMAC1,_ and _ras. CDKN2A (p16)_ appears to be especially important in both sporadic and hereditary melanomas. This tumor suppressor gene is located on band 9p21, and its mutation plays a role in various cancers."
Melanoma,https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/280245-overview,Malignant Melanoma,Ultraviolet radiation (Melanoma),"Exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation is a critical factor in the development of most melanomas. Ultraviolet A (UVA), wavelength 320-400 nm, and ultraviolet B (UVB), 290-320 nm, potentially are carcinogenic and actually may work in concert to induce a melanoma.
UV radiation appears to be an effective inducer of melanoma through many mechanisms, including suppression of the immune system of the skin, induction of melanocyte cell division, free radical production, and damage of melanocyte DNA.
Interestingly, melanoma does not have a direct relationship with the amount of sun exposure, because it is more common in white-collar workers than in those who work outdoors."
Melanoma,https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/280245-overview,Malignant Melanoma,Sunburn (Melanoma),"Acute, intense, and intermittent blistering sunburns, especially on areas of the body that only occasionally receive sun exposure, are the greatest risk factor for the development of sun exposure–induced melanoma on the trunk and legs, whereas lentigo maligna is associated with chronic sun exposure. This sun-associated risk factor is different from that for squamous and basal cell skin cancers, which are associated with prolonged, long-term sun exposure."
Melanoma,https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/280245-overview,Malignant Melanoma,Parkinson disease (Melanoma),"In the Mayo Clinic study, Dalvin et al found 32 cases of melanoma in 974 patients with PD (with 26 of the 32 diagnosed before the onset of PD), versus 63 cases in the control group of 2922 persons without PD; thus, the likelihood of having a history of melanoma was 3.8-fold higher in patients with PD compared with controls (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.1 - 6.8; _P_ < 0.001)."
Melanoma,https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/280245-overview,Malignant Melanoma,Racial demographics (Melanoma),"Melanoma is more common in Whites than in Blacks and Asians. The rate of melanoma in Blacks is estimated to be one twentieth that of Whites. White people with dark skin also have a much lower risk of developing melanoma than do those with light skin. The typical patient with melanoma has fair skin and a tendency to sunburn rather than tan. White people with blond or red hair and profuse freckling appear to be most prone to melanomas. In Hawaii and the southwestern United States, Whites have the highest incidence, approximately 20-30 cases per 100,000 population per year."
Melanoma,https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/280245-overview,Malignant Melanoma,Prognosis (Melanoma),"Malignant melanomas usually present at two extremes: at one end of the spectrum are patients with small skin lesions that are easily curable by surgical resection, and at the other are patients with widely metastatic disease, in whom the therapeutic options are limited and the prognosis is dismal, with a median survival of only 6-9 months. For this reason, physicians must be aware of the clinical characteristics of melanoma to make an early diagnosis.
* Thickness and/or level of invasion
* Mitotic index (mitoses per millimeter)
* Ulceration or bleeding at the primary site
* Number of regional lymph nodes involved, with distinction of macrometastasis and micrometastasis
* Systemic metastasis, including the site (nonvisceral versus lung versus all other visceral sites) and serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level elevation

* Younger age
* Female sex
* Melanoma located on the extremities"
Melanoma,https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/280245-treatment,Malignant Melanoma Treatment & Management,Approach Considerations (Melanoma),"Because the definitive treatment of cutaneous melanoma is surgery, medical management is reserved for adjuvant therapy of patients with advanced melanoma. Less than one half of patients with deep primaries (> 4 mm) or regional lymph node involvement have long-term disease-free survival; consequently, these patients are classified as high risk and should be considered for adjuvant therapy.
* Stage 0 - Excision
* Stage I - Excision, with or without lymph node management
* Stage II - Excision, with or without lymph node management
* Resectable stage III - Excision, with or without lymph node management; adjuvant therapy and immunotherapy
* Unresectable stage III, stage IV, and recurrent melanoma - Intralesional therapy, immunotherapy, signal transduction inhibitors, chemotherapy, palliative local therapy

Multiple options for adjuvant treatment of node-positive melanoma have become available. A critical question for guiding the choice of regimens is whether the tumor contains a _BRAF_ V600mutation. BRAF and BRAF/MEK inhibitor combinations are useful in some patients to slow the progression of disease.

The PD-L1/PD-1 interaction inhibits immune activation and reduces T-cell cytotoxic activity when bound. This negative feedback loop is essential for maintaining normal immune responses and limits T-cell activity to protect normal cells during chronic inflammation. Tumor cells may circumvent T-cell–mediated cytotoxicity by expressing PD-L1 on the tumor itself or on tumor-infiltrating immune cells, resulting in the inhibition of immune-mediated killing of tumor cells."

The treatment was quite toxic, with some patients requiring intensive care unit support. The more common toxicities included hypotension (45%), vomiting (37%), diarrhea (32%), and oliguria (39%). Consequently, this therapy is offered only in centers that have adequately trained staff and facilities. To qualify for IL-2 therapy, patients must have normal results on pulmonary function testing, brain imaging, and cardiac stress testing, plus adequate kidney and liver function.
_Carboplatin plus paclitaxel_
Combination therapy with carboplatin and paclitaxel has been tested in two small phase 2 studies, and when used together with sorafenib, the response rate was 11-17%. This regimen sometimes is used by clinicians in clinical practice because of lesser toxicity than dacarbazine and also as a second- or third-line regimen."

Melanoma,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK448124/,"[Bookshelf](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/ ""Bookshelf home"")",Etiology (Melanoma),"Acute compartment syndrome can occur with any condition that restricts the intracompartmental space or increases the fluid volume in the intracompartmental space. Acute compartment syndrome can occur without any precipitating trauma but typically occurs after a long bone fracture, with **tibial fractures** being the most common cause of the condition, followed by distal radius fractures. Seventy-five percent of cases of acute compartment syndrome are associated with fractures. After fractures, the most common cause of acute compartment syndrome is soft tissue injuries. Other causes of acute compartment syndrome include burns, vascular injuries, crush injuries, drug overdoses, reperfusion injuries, thrombosis, bleeding disorders, infections, improperly placed casts or splints, tight circumferential bandages, penetrating trauma, intense athletic activity, and poor positioning during surgery."
Melanoma,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK448124/,"[Bookshelf](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/ ""Bookshelf home"")",Epidemiology (Melanoma),"The incidence of acute compartment syndrome is estimated to be 7.3 per 100,000 in males and 0.7 per 100,000 in females, with the majority of cases occurring after trauma. Tibial shaft fracture is the most common cause of acute compartment syndrome, is associated with a 1 to 10 percent incidence of acute compartment syndrome.
Acute compartment syndrome occurs more commonly in males younger than 35, which may be due to a larger relative intracompartmental muscle mass and increased likelihood of being involved in high-energy trauma."
Melanoma,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK448124/,"[Bookshelf](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/ ""Bookshelf home"")",Pathophysiology (Melanoma),"Acute compartment syndrome occurs due to decreased intracompartmental space or increased intracompartmental fluid volume because the surrounding fascia is inherently non-compliant. As the compartment pressure increases, hemodynamics are impaired. There is normally an equilibrium between venous outflow and arterial inflow. When there is an increase in compartmental pressure, there is a reduction in venous outflow. This causes venous pressure and, thus, venous capillary pressure to increase. If the intracompartmental pressure becomes higher than arterial pressure, a decrease in arterial inflow will also occur. The reduction of venous outflow and arterial inflow result in decreased oxygenation of tissues causing ischemia. If the deficit of oxygenation becomes high enough, irreversible necrosis may occur."
Melanoma,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK448124/,"[Bookshelf](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/ ""Bookshelf home"")",History and Physical (Melanoma),"Acute compartment syndrome typically occurs within a few hours of inciting trauma. However, it can present up to 48 hours after. The earliest objective physical finding is the **tense** , or ''wood-like"" feeling of the involved compartment. **Pain** is typically severe, out of proportion to the injury. Early on, pain may only be present with passive stretching. However, this symptom may be absent in advanced acute compartment syndrome. In the initial stages, pain may be characterized as a burning sensation or as a deep ache of the involved compartment. Paresthesia, hypoesthesia, or poorly localized deep muscular pain may also be present.
Classically, the presentation of acute compartment syndrome has been remembered by ""The Five P's"": pain, pulselessness, paresthesia, paralysis, and pallor.However, aside from paresthesia, which may occur earlier in the course of the condition, these are typically late findings. Beware that the presence or absence of a palpable arterial pulse may not accurately indicate relative tissue pressure or predict the risk for compartment syndrome. In some patients, a pulse is still present, even in a severely compromised extremity.
**Physical exam** should focus on the neurovascular territory of the involved compartment:
* Observe skin for lesions, swelling, or color change
* Palpate over the compartment, observing temperature, tension, tenderness
* Check pulses
* Evaluate two-point discrimination and sensation
* Evaluate motor function

Due to the potential for rapid progression of compartment syndrome, clinicians should perform serial exams."
Melanoma,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK448124/,"[Bookshelf](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/ ""Bookshelf home"")",Evaluation (Melanoma),"Acute compartment syndrome is a clinical diagnosis and needs prompt treatment. However, the following are done to evaluate further and to confirm the diagnosis.
* Radiographs should be obtained if a fracture is suspected
* Measurement of intracompartmental pressure is not required but can aid in diagnosis if uncertainty exists. Compartment pressures are often measured with a manometer, a device that detects intracompartmental pressure by measuring the resistance that is present when a saline solution is injected into the compartment. Another method employs a slit catheter, whereby a catheter is placed within the compartment, and the pressure is measured with an arterial line transducer. The slit catheter method is more accurate and allows for continuous monitoring. Its use is also recommended to measure all the surrounding compartments.
* The normal pressure within the compartment is between 0 mmHg to 8 mmHg.
* When intra-compartmental pressure increases to within 10 mmHg to 30 mmHg of the patient's diastolic blood pressure, this indicates inadequate perfusion and relative ischemia of the involved extremity.
* The perfusion pressureof a compartment, also known as the compartment **delta pressure** , is defined as the difference between the diastolic blood pressure and the intra-compartmental pressure:
* delta pressure = diastolic pressure - measured intracompartmental pressure
* clinicians often utilize delta pressure less than or equal to 30 mmHg as indicative of the need for fasciotomy.
* Ultrasound with Doppler can be used to look for occlusion or thrombus.
* Elevations in creatine phosphokinase (CPK) may suggest muscle breakdown from ischemia, damage, or rhabdomyolysis.
* If rhabdomyolysis is being considered, renal function tests, urine myoglobin, and urinalysis should be done.
* If rhabdomyolysis is diagnosed, a chemistry panel is needed."
Melanoma,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK448124/,"[Bookshelf](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/ ""Bookshelf home"")",Treatment / Management (Melanoma),"* Immediate**surgical consult**
* Provide supplemental oxygen.
* Remove any restrictive casts, dressings, or bandages to relieve pressure.
* Keep the extremity at the level of the heart to prevent hypo-perfusion.
* Prevent hypotension and provide blood pressure support in patients with hypotension.
* If**ICP is greater than or equal to 30 mmHg** or**delta pressure is less than or equal to 30 mmHg, fasciotomy should be done**.

For patients who do not meet diagnostic criteria for acute compartment syndrome but who are at high risk based on history and physical exam findings, or for patients with intracompartmental pressures between 15 to 20 mmHg, serial intracompartmental pressure measurements are recommended. Patients with ICPs between 20-30 mmHg should be admitted and the surgical team should be consulted. For patients with intracompartmental pressures greater than 30 mmHg or delta pressures less than 30 mmHg, surgical fasciotomy should be done.
Acute compartment syndrome is a surgical emergency, so prompt diagnosis and treatment are critical. Once the diagnosis is confirmed, immediate surgical fasciotomy is needed to reduce the intracompartmental pressure. The ideal timeframe for fasciotomy is within six hours of injury, and fasciotomy is not recommended after 36 hours following injury. When tissue pressure remains elevated for that amount of time, irreversible damage may occur, and fasciotomy may not be beneficial in this situation.
If necrosis occurs before fasciotomy is performed, there is a high likelihood of infection which may require amputation. If infection occurs, debridement is necessary to prevent systemic spread or other complications."

Without proper management, acute compartment syndrome can lead to high morbidity and poor outcomes.
* The nurses are usually the first health professional to see the patient, often in triage in the emergency department. The nurse must quickly recognize the signs and symptoms consistent with compartment syndrome and immediately involve the clinical team to further evaluate the patient. The nurses will need to assist in monitoring the patient's vital signs, pain, and assist in getting the patient to the operating room where definitive treatment usually takes place. After the procedure, they will need ongoing evaluation as often a patient with compartment syndrome will have multiple other injuries that require attention as well as complications as a direct result of the compartment damage.
* Pharmacists in the emergency department can assist in medication reconciliation as well as provide recommendations regarding pain management.
* The nurse practitioner, physician assistant, and physicians often provide a role in coordinating the care, performing procedures, as well as educating the patient and family regarding the nature of the injuries."

You may have tests to rule out other conditions, such as psoriasis or lupus. Some symptoms of rosacea may be harder to see on brown and Black skin. These include spider veins and flushing. So it's important to pay attention to other symptoms, such as swelling, bumps, facial stinging and dry-looking skin.
If your symptoms involve your eyes, you may see an eye doctor, also called an ophthalmologist, for other tests."

This kind of medicine may help ease symptoms. For more serious rosacea, you might need prescription pills. Laser treatment may be used to reduce flushing and enlarged blood vessels in the face.
How long you need treatment depends on the type of rosacea you have and how serious your symptoms are. Even if your skin calms with treatment, the symptoms often return."
Benign keratosis-like lesions,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/seborrheic-keratosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20353822,[Rosacea](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/rosacea/symptoms-causes/syc-20353815),Medicines (Benign keratosis-like lesions),"Several medicines are used to help control rosacea symptoms. The type of medicine you are prescribed depends on your symptoms. For example, some medicines or treatments work better for flushing, and some medicines work better for pimples and bumps. You may need to try one or more medicines to find a treatment that works for you.
Medicines for rosacea include:
* **Gels or other products applied to the skin.** For the flushing of mild to moderate rosacea, you may try a medicated cream or gel that you apply to the affected skin. Examples are brimonidine (Mirvaso) and oxymetazoline (Rhofade), which reduce flushing by constricting blood vessels. You may see results within 12 hours after use. The effect on the blood vessels is temporary. Overuse might lead to worse flushing. So rather than using it every day, you might use it only before important events.
Brimonidine and oxymetazoline often aren't covered by insurance.
Other prescription topical products help control the pimples of mild rosacea. Examples are azelaic acid (Azelex, Finacea), metronidazole (Metrogel, Noritate, others) and ivermectin (Soolantra). With azelaic acid and metronidazole, you may not see results for 2 to 6 weeks. Ivermectin may take even longer to improve skin. But the results tend to last longer than they do for metronidazole. Sometimes, using two or more of these products leads to the best results.
* **Antibiotic medicine taken by mouth.** For more serious rosacea with bumps and pimples, you may be prescribed an oral antibiotic pill such as doxycycline (Oracea, others).
* **Acne medicine taken by mouth.** For severe rosacea that doesn't respond to other medicine, you may be prescribed isotretinoin (Amnesteem, Claravis, others). It's a powerful oral acne medicine that also helps clear up the bumps of rosacea. This medicine is not to be taken during pregnancy as it can cause birth defects."
Benign keratosis-like lesions,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/seborrheic-keratosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20353822,[Rosacea](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/rosacea/symptoms-causes/syc-20353815),Laser treatment (Benign keratosis-like lesions),"Laser treatment can help improve the look of enlarged blood vessels. It also can help the long-term redness of rosacea. And it often works better than a cream or a pill for this symptom. Because the laser targets visible veining, this method is most effective on skin that isn't tanned, brown or Black.
Talk with a member of your healthcare team about the risks and benefits of laser treatment. Common side effects include redness, bruising and mild swelling for a few days following the treatment. Rare side effects include blistering and scarring. Icing and gentle skin care help while you heal. On brown or Black skin, laser treatment might cause long-term or permanent changes to the color of the treated skin.
The full effect of the treatment might not be seen for weeks. Repeat treatments may be needed to keep the improved look of your skin.
Laser treatment for rosacea is sometimes considered a cosmetic procedure. Such procedures often aren't covered by insurance. However, nowadays some insurances do cover the procedure. Check with your insurance company directly to see if they cover laser treatment for rosacea.

* **Identify and avoid things that make your symptoms worse.** Notice what tends to cause flare-ups for you and avoid those things.
* **Protect your face.** Use a broad-spectrum sunscreen or moisturizer containing sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30, even on cloudy days. Apply sunscreen generously. Reapply every two hours, or more often if you're swimming or sweating.
People with rosacea might benefit from selecting sunscreens that contain titanium dioxide, zinc or both. These are called mineral-based sunscreens or physical sunscreens. Examples include Eucerin Sensitive Mineral Zinc Oxide Protection, La Roche-Posay Tinted Mineral, and others. Or look for products with silicone, such as dimethicone, or cyclomethicone.
Apply sunscreen after you put on any medicine for your face and before applying makeup, if you use it.
Take other steps to protect your face, such as wearing a hat and avoiding midday sun. In cold, windy weather, wear a scarf or ski mask.
* **Treat your skin gently.** Don't rub or touch your face too much. Use a nonsoap cleanser two times a day and moisturize. Some face creams may help reduce redness. Products made for the face that contain azelaic acid, dicarboxylic or niacinamide may help with rosacea symptoms. These products are available without a prescription.
Choose fragrance-free products, and avoid those that contain skin irritants such as alcohol, camphor, urea and menthol.
* **Reduce facial symptoms with makeup.** Some makeup products may help reduce the facial flushing common with rosacea. For example, green-tinted makeup can help cover up the red color. Avoid alcohol-based gels and thin lotions."

Benign keratosis-like lesions,https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/21721-seborrheic-keratosis,Seborrheic Keratosis,What is seborrheic keratosis? (Benign keratosis-like lesions),"A seborrheic keratosis (seb-o-REE-ik ker-uh-TOE-sis) is a common benign skin growth, similar to a mole. Most people will have at least one in their lifetime. They tend to appear in mid-adulthood and their frequency increases with age. They are harmless and don’t require treatment, but you can have them removed if they bother you."
Benign keratosis-like lesions,https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/21721-seborrheic-keratosis,Seborrheic Keratosis,What does seborrheic keratosis look like? (Benign keratosis-like lesions),"Seborrheic keratoses are roundish or oval-shaped patches on the skin with a “stuck on” appearance. They are sometimes described as waxy or scaly. They are raised above the skin and even when they are flat you can feel them with your finger. They are usually brown, but can also be black or tan, and less often, pink, yellow or white. They often appear in numbers.
Seborrheic keratoses are characterized by keratin on the surface — the same fibrous protein that fingernails, hooves, and horns are made of. This causes the textural details that often distinguish the growths. Sometimes it looks like small bubbles or cysts within the growth. Sometimes it looks scabby or wart-like. Sometimes it looks like the ridges and fissures in a brain."
Benign keratosis-like lesions,https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/21721-seborrheic-keratosis,Seborrheic Keratosis,Who gets seborrheic keratosis? (Benign keratosis-like lesions),"Anyone can get one, but most commonly:
* **People who are 50 and older.** They usually begin to appear in middle age, and rarely in younger people. About 30% of people have at least one by the age of 40, and about 75% by the age of 70.
* **People with a family history of it.** About half of all cases of multiple seborrheic keratoses occur in families, suggesting that the tendency to develop many of them may be inherited.
* **Lighter-skinned people.** Classic seborrheic keratosis as described here appears less frequently in darker-skinned people. However, a variant of seborrheic keratosis called _dermatosis papulosa nigra_ is very common in darker-skinned people, including those of African, Asian and Hispanic descent."
Benign keratosis-like lesions,https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/21721-seborrheic-keratosis,Seborrheic Keratosis,What triggers seborrheic keratosis? (Benign keratosis-like lesions),"We don't know exactly why these growths occur, but we can look at the circumstances that often go along with it. The first is age: seborrheic keratoses are especially common in adults over 50, and they tend to multiply as people get older. Some studies suggest that sun exposure may increase their occurrence. They also appear more frequently in families, which suggests that genetics may play a role. They are not viral or bacterial. They don’t spread and they aren’t contagious.
Seborrheic keratoses usually grow slowly and may develop their texture gradually over time. If many seborrheic keratoses erupt suddenly together, it might raise some concern. This unusual occurrence has sometimes been considered a sign of internal cancer. Doctors call it “the sign of Leser Trélat”. The correlation is not yet proven or explained and may only be a coincidence. But your healthcare provider might want to screen you for any other signs of internal cancer."
Benign keratosis-like lesions,https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/21721-seborrheic-keratosis,Seborrheic Keratosis,Do seborrheic keratoses cause symptoms? (Benign keratosis-like lesions),"They usually don’t, but people sometimes report:
* Itching.
* Irritation from friction.
* Bleeding.

If these symptoms annoy you, you may want to have the growth removed."
Benign keratosis-like lesions,https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/21721-seborrheic-keratosis,Seborrheic Keratosis,How do you tell seborrheic keratosis from actinic keratosis? (Benign keratosis-like lesions),"Actinic keratoses vary in color, but they tend to be less pigmented than seborrheic keratoses. They can be flat or slightly raised, but tend to be flatter, and you might feel them before you see them. They feel scaly and rough, but may become more bumpy and wart-like over time, like seborrheic keratoses. They may also itch and bleed. They tend to appear in clusters in frequently sun-exposed areas."
Benign keratosis-like lesions,https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/21721-seborrheic-keratosis,Seborrheic Keratosis,How do you tell seborrheic keratosis from melanoma? (Benign keratosis-like lesions),"* Seborrheic keratoses often appear in numbers, while melanoma is usually single.
* Seborrheic keratoses tend to have texture, while melanoma tends to be smooth.
* Seborrheic keratoses are well-defined, while melanoma can have a ragged or blurry border.
* Seborrheic keratoses are uniform, while melanoma may be asymmetrical or have more than one color.
* Seborrheic keratoses change little and slowly, while melanoma can grow and change quickly."
Benign keratosis-like lesions,https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/21721-seborrheic-keratosis,Seborrheic Keratosis,How is seborrheic keratosis diagnosed? (Benign keratosis-like lesions),"* **Examination.** Dermatologists can usually identify a seborrheic keratosis with the naked eye.
* **Dermoscopy.** If in doubt, your healthcare provider may look at the growth under a dermascope, a small, handheld lighted microscope."
Benign keratosis-like lesions,https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/21721-seborrheic-keratosis,Seborrheic Keratosis,How is seborrheic keratosis treated? (Benign keratosis-like lesions),"You should always have new skin growths clinically diagnosed to make sure they aren’t cancerous. Different kinds of skin growths can be hard to tell apart from each other. If your healthcare provider is in any doubt about your growth, they might want to remove it for biopsy.
If it is clearly a seborrheic keratosis, it won’t require any treatment. But you might want to have it removed if it becomes itchy or irritated or you don’t like the look of it. Your healthcare provider can remove it for you in the office using one of several common methods."
Benign keratosis-like lesions,https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/21721-seborrheic-keratosis,Seborrheic Keratosis,What can I expect if I have seborrheic keratoses? (Benign keratosis-like lesions),"They may continue to grow at a slow pace. You may continue to grow new ones. They occasionally, but rarely, recede."
Benign keratosis-like lesions,https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/21721-seborrheic-keratosis,Seborrheic Keratosis,What can I expect if I’ve had my seborrheic keratosis removed?

(Benign keratosis-like lesions),"For the most part, you don’t have to worry about your seborrheic keratosis. However, you should see your healthcare provider if you notice:
* You have a new, unidentified growth.
* It’s itching, irritated or bleeding.
* An old seborrheic keratosis changed its appearance.
* Many growths suddenly develop in a short period."
Benign keratosis-like lesions,https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/21721-seborrheic-keratosis,Seborrheic Keratosis,A note from Cleveland Clinic (Benign keratosis-like lesions),"Seborrheic keratosis is nothing to worry about, but you should have it diagnosed just to make sure it isn’t something else that could be more harmful. If you want to have it removed, there are a number of options available. Your healthcare provider can walk you through the pros and cons of each method and help you determine the best one for you, based on the nature and location of the growth. Seborrheic keratoses that are removed will not return, but you might get a new one somewhere else."

Benign keratosis-like lesions,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/age-spots/symptoms-causes/syc-20352576,Endocarditis,Overview (Benign keratosis-like lesions),"Endocarditis is a life-threatening inflammation of the inner lining of the heart's chambers and valves. This lining is called the endocardium.
Endocarditis is usually caused by an infection. Bacteria, fungi or other germs get into the bloodstream and attach to damaged areas in the heart. Things that make you more likely to get endocarditis are artificial heart valves, damaged heart valves or other heart defects.
Without quick treatment, endocarditis can damage or destroy the heart valves. Treatments for endocarditis include medications and surgery."
Benign keratosis-like lesions,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/age-spots/symptoms-causes/syc-20352576,Endocarditis,Endocarditis (Benign keratosis-like lesions),Endocarditis occurs when bacteria or other germs enter the bloodstream and travel to the heart. The germs then stick to damaged heart valves or damaged heart tissue.
Benign keratosis-like lesions,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/age-spots/symptoms-causes/syc-20352576,Endocarditis,Symptoms (Benign keratosis-like lesions),"Symptoms of endocarditis can vary from person to person. Endocarditis may develop slowly or suddenly. It depends on the type of germs causing the infection and whether there are other heart problems.
Common symptoms of endocarditis include:
* Aching joints and muscles
* Chest pain when you breathe
* Fatigue
* Flu-like symptoms, such as fever and chills
* Night sweats
* Shortness of breath
* Swelling in the feet, legs or belly
* A new or changed whooshing sound in the heart (murmur)

Less common endocarditis symptoms can include:
* Unexplained weight loss
* Blood in the urine

The germs enter the bloodstream and travel to the heart. In the heart, they attach to damaged heart valves or damaged heart tissue.
Usually, the body's immune system destroys any harmful bacteria that enter the bloodstream. However, bacteria on the skin or in the mouth, throat or gut (intestines) may enter the bloodstream and cause endocarditis under the right circumstances."
Benign keratosis-like lesions,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/age-spots/symptoms-causes/syc-20352576,Endocarditis,Risk factors (Benign keratosis-like lesions),"Many different things can cause germs to get into the bloodstream and lead to endocarditis. Having a faulty, diseased or damaged heart valve increases the risk of the condition. However, endocarditis may occur in those without heart valve problems.
Risk factors for endocarditis include:
* **Older age.** Endocarditis occurs most often in adults over age 60.
* **Artificial heart valves.** Germs are more likely to attach to an artificial (prosthetic) heart valve than to a regular heart valve.
* **Damaged heart valves.** Certain medical conditions, such as rheumatic fever or infection, can damage or scar one or more of the heart valves, increasing the risk of infection. A history of endocarditis also increases the risk of infection.
* **Congenital heart defects.** Being born with certain types of heart defects, such as an irregular heart or damaged heart valves, raises the risk of heart infections.
* **Implanted heart device.** Bacteria can attach to an implanted device, such as a pacemaker, causing an infection of the heart's lining.
* **Illegal intravenous (IV) drug use.** Using dirty IV needles can lead to infections such as endocarditis. Contaminated needles and syringes are a special concern for people who use illegal IV drugs, such as heroin or cocaine.
* **Poor dental health.** A healthy mouth and healthy gums are essential for good health. If you don't brush and floss regularly, bacteria can grow inside your mouth and may enter your bloodstream through a cut on your gums. Some dental procedures that can cut the gums also may allow bacteria to get in the bloodstream.
* **Long-term catheter use.** A catheter is a thin tube that's used to do some medical procedures. Having a catheter in place for a long period of time (indwelling catheter) increases the risk of endocarditis."
Benign keratosis-like lesions,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/age-spots/symptoms-causes/syc-20352576,Endocarditis,Chambers and valves of the heart (Benign keratosis-like lesions),"A typical heart has two upper and two lower chambers. The upper chambers, the right and left atria, receive incoming blood. The lower chambers, the more muscular right and left ventricles, pump blood out of the heart. The heart valves, which keep blood flowing in the right direction, are gates at the chamber openings.
If you're at risk of endocarditis, tell your health care providers. You may want to request an endocarditis wallet card from the American Heart Association. Check with your local chapter or print the card from the association's website."

These clumps are called vegetations. They can break loose and travel to the brain, lungs, kidneys and other organs. They can also travel to the arms and legs.
Complications of endocarditis may include:

* **Take care of your teeth and gums.** Brush and floss your teeth and gums often. Get regular dental checkups. Good dental hygiene is an important part of maintaining your overall health.
* **Don't use illegal IV drugs.** Dirty needles can send bacteria into the bloodstream, increasing the risk of endocarditis."

You're at high risk of endocarditis and need antibiotics before dental work if you have:
* A history of endocarditis
* A mechanical heart valve
* A heart transplant, in some cases
* Certain types of congenital heart disease
* Congenital heart disease surgery in the last six months

If you have endocarditis or any type of congenital heart disease, talk to your dentist and other care providers about your risks and whether you need preventive antibiotics.

Benign keratosis-like lesions,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/age-spots/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20352579,Endocarditis,Overview (Benign keratosis-like lesions),"Endocarditis is a life-threatening inflammation of the inner lining of the heart's chambers and valves. This lining is called the endocardium.
Endocarditis is usually caused by an infection. Bacteria, fungi or other germs get into the bloodstream and attach to damaged areas in the heart. Things that make you more likely to get endocarditis are artificial heart valves, damaged heart valves or other heart defects.
Without quick treatment, endocarditis can damage or destroy the heart valves. Treatments for endocarditis include medications and surgery."
Benign keratosis-like lesions,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/age-spots/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20352579,Endocarditis,Endocarditis (Benign keratosis-like lesions),Endocarditis occurs when bacteria or other germs enter the bloodstream and travel to the heart. The germs then stick to damaged heart valves or damaged heart tissue.
Benign keratosis-like lesions,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/age-spots/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20352579,Endocarditis,Symptoms (Benign keratosis-like lesions),"Symptoms of endocarditis can vary from person to person. Endocarditis may develop slowly or suddenly. It depends on the type of germs causing the infection and whether there are other heart problems.
Common symptoms of endocarditis include:
* Aching joints and muscles
* Chest pain when you breathe
* Fatigue
* Flu-like symptoms, such as fever and chills
* Night sweats
* Shortness of breath
* Swelling in the feet, legs or belly
* A new or changed whooshing sound in the heart (murmur)

Less common endocarditis symptoms can include:
* Unexplained weight loss
* Blood in the urine
* Tenderness under the left rib cage (spleen)
* Painless red, purple or brown flat spots on the soles bottom of the feet or the palms of the hands (Janeway lesions)

Benign keratosis-like lesions,https://dermnetnz.org/topics/lentigo,**Lentigo**,What are the clinical features of lentigines? (Benign keratosis-like lesions),"Lentigines have been classified into several different types depending on what they look like, where they appear on the body, causative factors, and whether they are associated to other diseases or conditions.
Lentigines may be solitary or more often, multiple. Most lentigines are smaller than 5 mm in diameter."

* Dermatoscopy

* Thickened epidermis
* An increased number of melanocytes along the basal layer of epidermis
* Unlike junctional melanocytic naevus, there are no nests of melanocytes
* Increased melanin pigment within the keratinocytes
* Additional features depending on type of lentigo

In contrast, an ephelis (freckle) shows sun-induced increased melanin within the keratinocytes, without an increase in number of cells."

(Benign keratosis-like lesions)","**Garden:** Age spots are common benign skin spots with clearly defined edges on your face or other sun-exposed areas. They usually form due to exposure to the sun. Other sources of UV light, such as tanning beds, can also be a source. Some types of spots and growths also occur as we age, which people may refer to as age spots. All of these should be evaluated by a dermatologist to rule out a more serious type of pigmented spot."

* **Don't wait.** “No matter your age, your older self will thank you if you start protecting your skin now,” he says.
* **Cover up.** Wear sun-protective clothing. Even if it’s warm, wear a lightweight cover-up to shield your skin. Top it off with a wide-brimmed hat.
* **Prevent a repeat.** “Even if your spots fade with treatment, the residual spots will become darker with ongoing sun exposure,” says Garden. Protect them from the sun to prevent a repeat.

Benign keratosis-like lesions,https://dermnetnz.org/topics/lichenoid-keratosis,**Lichenoid keratosis**,What is lichenoid keratosis? (Benign keratosis-like lesions),"Lichenoid keratosis is a small, inflamed macule or thin pigmented plaque, usually solitary, with a lichenoid tissue reaction on histology."
Benign keratosis-like lesions,https://dermnetnz.org/topics/lichenoid-keratosis,**Lichenoid keratosis**,What are the clinical features of lichenoid keratosis? (Benign keratosis-like lesions),"* A solitary lesion is present in 90% of cases of lichenoid keratosis, with others presenting with multiple lesions.
* It is most commonly found on the upper trunk, followed by the distal upper extremities, and less commonly on the head and neck.
* Size ranges from a few millimetres to one centimetre or more in size.
* The skin surface may be smooth, scaly, or warty.
* The lesion is often asymptomatic. It may be itchy or have a mild stinging sensation.

The clinical features of lichenoid keratosis vary depending on the inflammatory stage of the lesion.
Classic, bullous, or atypical subtype
---
Clinical features |
* Acute rapidly developing lesion (present for 3 months)
* Erythematous or pinkish papule or plaque

Histopathology |
* Bullous variant shows intraepidermal or subepidermal bullous cavities with dense lymphocytic infiltrate and increased number of necrotic basilar layer keratinocytes.
* Atypical variant shows similar histology to classic type with scattered enlarged CD-3, CD-30 (+) lymphocytes with hyperchromatic, irregular nuclei.

Early or interface subtype
Clinical features |
* Subacute lesions present for 3 months to one year
* Erythematous to dusky-red or hyperpigmented brown lesion
* Depending on the age of lesion, dermoscopy may show features of a solar lentigo or flat seborrhoeic keratosis with moth-eaten borders, fingerprinting, milia-like cysts, comedo-like openings, plus small foci of melanophages (grey dots).

Histopathology |
* Single lymphocytes aligned along the dermoepidermal junction without epidermal acanthosis and adjacent lentigo

Late regressed or atrophic subtype
Clinical features |
* Lesions have been present for more than one year
* May be violaceous papules or irregularly distributed lesions with shades of brown or grey

Histopathology |
* Epidermal atrophy with papillary dermal scarring, patchy lymphocytic infiltrates and melanin incontinence

Multiple eruptive lichenoid keratoses in sun-exposed sites are also described. Their colour varies from an initial reddish brown to a greyish purple/brown as the lesion resolves several weeks or months later.

Benign keratosis-like lesions,https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1059477-clinical,Seborrheic Keratosis Clinical Presentation,History (Benign keratosis-like lesions),"Seborrheic keratoses usually are asymptomatic, but they can be an annoyance. Lesions can itch and rub or catch on clothing, thereby becoming inflamed.
Patients are sometimes concerned that these enlarging lesions are malignant. Sometimes a person may have many seborrheic keratoses and not notice a dysplastic nevus or a malignant melanoma that develops among the seborrheic keratoses. A significant danger can arise if a person does not detect a malignant melanoma at an early stage.
Although lesions may resolve on occasion, spontaneous resolution does not ordinarily occur.
Seborrheic keratoses usually begin with the appearance of one or more sharply defined, light brown, flat macules. The lesions may be sparse or numerous.
As they initially grow, they develop a velvety to finely verrucous surface, followed by an uneven warty surface with multiple plugged follicles and a dull or lackluster appearance."

Seborrheic Keratosis
Seborrheic Keratoses (Back)
Dermatosis Papulosa Nigra
Leser-Trélat Sign
The cause of seborrheic keratosis is unknown, but genetic mutations have been identified in certain types. The lesions commonly occur in middle age and later and most often appear on the trunk or temples. In dark-skinned people, multiple 1- to 3-mm lesions can occur on the cheekbones; this condition is termed dermatosis papulosa nigra.
Seborrheic keratoses vary in size and grow slowly. They may be round or oval and flesh-colored, brown, or black. They usually appear stuck on and may have a verrucous, velvety, waxy, scaling, or crusted surface.
Manifestations of Seborrheic Keratoses

Benign keratosis-like lesions,https://www.healthline.com/health/lentigo,Lentigo (Liver Spots),Lentigo symptoms (Benign keratosis-like lesions),Lentigo doesn’t cause any symptoms other than the spots themselves. They’re not itchy or painful. They won’t cause irritation on your skin.
Benign keratosis-like lesions,https://www.healthline.com/health/lentigo,Lentigo (Liver Spots),How to identify lentigo (Benign keratosis-like lesions),"Skin cancer tends to produce spots that are raised, painful, itchy, grow rapidly, have uneven borders, and have multiple colors. If you have a spot or mole with any of those characteristics, it’s always best to see a doctor as soon as possible.
##
What does lentigo (liver spots) look like?
This image gallery shows what lentigo looks like, compared to freckles and basal cell carcinoma (a type of skin cancer).
##
How do you get lentigo (liver spots)?
Lentigo is primarily caused by sun exposure. The sun’s UV radiation causes skin cells called melanocytes to produce more pigmentation in your skin. This is why people tan, burn, or freckle after spending time in the sun."
Benign keratosis-like lesions,https://www.healthline.com/health/lentigo,Lentigo (Liver Spots),Ordering products online (Benign keratosis-like lesions),"Remember to use caution ordering any products for lentigo online. You’ll likely see creams and other products for sale that promise dramatic results. Often, these products rarely live up to the hype. Sometimes these products are dangerous and can potentially damage your skin.
It’s always a good idea to talk with a doctor or dermatologist before you use any cream or lotion.
##
Can you prevent lentigo (liver spots)?
To prevent lentigo, try to avoid sun exposure, especially during the peak sun hours between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. When you do go outside in the sun, always wear sunscreen with UVA/UVB protection. It’s best if you choose a sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30 and reapply it every 2 hours.
It’s also a great idea to wear sun-protective clothing and a wide-brimmed hat.
##
Takeaway
Lentigo spots (liver spots) are not cancer and are not dangerous.
You can choose to have them removed for cosmetic reasons, but they’re not harmful. It’s safest to have a doctor look at your spot if you’re not sure if it’s a lentigo or another skin condition. They can make sure your spot is lentigo and not skin cancer.
In most cases, lentigo is caused by repeated sun exposure. You can prevent lentigo by taking steps to keep your skin safe from safe UV rays, like always wearing sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30 and wearing sun-protective clothing."

What happens if seborrheic keratosis is left untreated?
##
How do you get rid of seborrheic keratosis?
Seborrheic keratosis doesn’t need treatment. However, a healthcare professional such as a dermatologist may decide to remove growths if they have a suspicious appearance or cause physical or emotional discomfort.
Treatment and removal methods for seborrheic keratosis can include the following:
* **Curettage:** In curettage, a healthcare professional scrapes off the growth with a curette, a scoop-like surgical instrument. Curettage is sometimes combined with electrosurgery.
* **Ablation:** This procedure uses a special laser to vaporize the growth.

After having seborrheic keratosis professionally removed, your skin may be lighter at the site of removal. The difference in skin color often becomes less noticeable over time.
Most of the time a seborrheic keratosis growth won’t return, but it’s possible to develop a new one on another part of your body."
Benign keratosis-like lesions,https://www.healthline.com/health/seborrheic-keratosis,Seborrheic Keratosis Explained,Is it okay to scratch off seborrheic keratosis? (Benign keratosis-like lesions),"Dermatologists recommend not removing skin growths yourself.
Attempting to remove seborrheic keratosis by picking or scratching at it can result in complications, such as:
* bleeding

Because doctors typically submit growths removed from your skin to a lab for testing, removing a growth yourself can potentially also delay a skin cancer diagnosis.
##
What causes seborrheic keratosis?
Experts don’t know what causes seborrheic keratosis to develop. They aren‘t bacterial, viral, or contagious.
The following risk factors may make you more likely to develop a seborrheic keratosis:
* **Having family members with seborrheic keratosis:** This skin condition appears to run in families and can often be inherited. The risk increases with the number of affected biological relatives.

##
How is seborrheic keratosis diagnosed?
A trained pathologist then examines the biopsy sample under a microscope. This step can help a doctor or dermatologist diagnose the growth as either seborrheic keratosis or something else.
##
When should I see a doctor for skin growths?
A seborrheic keratosis isn’t dangerous, but it can be difficult to distinguish between harmless and dangerous growths. Something that looks like seborrheic keratosis could actually be melanoma.
* There’s a new growth.
* There’s a change in the appearance of an existing growth.
* There’s only one growth (seborrheic keratosis usually appears as several growths).
* A growth has an unusual color, such as purple, blue, or reddish-black.
* A growth has borders that are blurred, jagged, or otherwise irregular.
* A growth is irritated or painful.

If you’re worried about any growth, make an appointment with a doctor or dermatologist. It’s better to be too cautious than ignore a potentially serious problem."

Additional causes include athletic injuries, falls, and assaults. Clinicians commonly diagnose these fractures using lateral chest radiographs or chest computed tomography scans. Sternal fractures significantly increase the risk of other injuries, which influences patient disposition regarding associated injuries, comorbidities, and pain management. Most patients with sternal fractures present to the emergency department and may require close monitoring, sometimes in an intensive care unit. Although most patients recover within 4 to 6 weeks, some may experience chronic pain or nonunion.
The evaluation and management of sternal fractures follow Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) guidelines. This begins with an assessment of the airway, breathing, and circulation, followed by a primary survey to address life-threatening conditions. Associated injuries, such as tension pneumothorax, hemothorax, cardiac tamponade, and flail chest, must be promptly managed. While sternal fractures pose significant risks, effective management and multidisciplinary care usually lead to favorable patient outcomes. This activity outlines the evaluation and treatment of sternal fractures and describes the role of the interprofessional healthcare team in providing care to patients with this injury."

* Implement Advanced Trauma Life Support guidelines in treating patients with suspected sternal fractures.
* Select appropriate imaging techniques, including lateral radiographs and computed tomography scans, to accurately diagnose sternal fractures.
* Collaborate with an interprofessional healthcare team, including nurses and respiratory and physical therapists, to provide comprehensive care for patients with sternal fractures."
Benign keratosis-like lesions,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK507790/,"[Bookshelf](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/ ""Bookshelf home"")",History and Physical (Benign keratosis-like lesions),"The most common causes of sternal fractures are blunt anterior chest wall trauma and deceleration injuries. Motor vehicle collisions, athletic injuries, falls, and assaults are the most frequent causes. Sternal fractures typically present with anterior chest wall pain. Up to one-fifth of cases may also experience shortness of breath. Deep breathing and coughing can exacerbate the pain. In cases of sternal stress fractures or acute insufficiency fractures, the pain may mimic other severe medical conditions due to the absence of a clear mechanism of injury, and it tends to be more diffuse."
Benign keratosis-like lesions,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK507790/,"[Bookshelf](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/ ""Bookshelf home"")",Evaluation (Benign keratosis-like lesions),"A chest CT scan is another standard diagnostic test for patients with a high index of suspicion of sternal fracture. Axial CT scans may be less sensitive than plain radiographs, as they can sometimes miss transverse sternal fractures. Spiral CT scans are likely the most sensitive, although no gold standard exists. Chest CT scans are also advantageous in ruling out associated injuries due to sternal fractures. Ultrasonography can detect sternal fractures with equal or greater sensitivity than plain radiography. Bedside ultrasonography may significantly reduce the time to diagnosis; however, limiting factors, including inter-operator variability, must be considered.
Cardiac monitoring and pulse oximetry should be initiated for all patients in the emergency department with sternal fractures. Electrocardiograms should be conducted to assess signs of myocardial contusions, such as arrhythmias, conduction disturbances, sinus tachycardia, or ST-segment changes. Enzyme markers of cardiac injury may be helpful if cardiac contusion is suspected, with troponin elevation particularly indicative of myocardial injury. Echocardiography assists in detecting myocardial contusions by providing a direct view of wall motion abnormalities."

Hospital admission is unnecessary if no concerns are identified during clinical evaluation. Patients should follow up with their primary care physician within the first 24 hours. Deep breathing exercises are beneficial in preventing pulmonary complications. Surgical fixation may be required for significantly displaced or unstable fractures. However, most isolated sternal fractures heal spontaneously over an average period of 10 weeks."

Displaced or unstable sternal fractures increase the risk of pulmonary injuries, pericardial effusions, rib fractures, and spinal compression fractures. Chest pain can persist for 8 to 12 weeks post-injury. Painful inspiration may lead to atelectasis, pneumonia, and other pulmonary complications. The nonunion, false joint formation and overlap deformities of sternal fractures are rare but may necessitate delayed surgical intervention. Advanced age, osteoporosis, prolonged steroid use, and diabetes elevate the risk of delayed healing. Rare complications such as osteomyelitis, sternal abscess, and mediastinitis may occur. Large hematoma formation, intravenous drug abuse, and concurrent staphylococcal infections increase the risk of infectious complications."

Hence, nurses should be well-versed in managing these types of fractures and their potential complications. Respiratory therapists are critical in ensuring proper chest physiotherapy for these patients.
Most patients with sternal fractures experience an excellent recovery within 4 to 6 weeks. However, a small number of patients may rarely develop chronic pain or nonunion.

Basal cell carcinoma,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/basal-cell-carcinoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20354187,Basal cell carcinoma,Overview (Basal cell carcinoma),"Basal cell carcinoma is a type of skin cancer. Basal cell carcinoma begins in the basal cells — a type of cell within the skin that produces new skin cells as old ones die off.
Basal cell carcinoma often appears as a slightly transparent bump on the skin, though it can take other forms. Basal cell carcinoma occurs most often on areas of the skin that are exposed to the sun, such as your head and neck.
Most basal cell carcinomas are thought to be caused by long-term exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from sunlight. Avoiding the sun and using sunscreen may help protect against basal cell carcinoma."
Basal cell carcinoma,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/basal-cell-carcinoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20354187,Basal cell carcinoma,Basal cell carcinoma on white skin,"Basal cell carcinoma is a type of skin cancer that most often develops on areas of skin exposed to the sun, such as the face. On white skin, basal cell carcinoma often looks like a bump that's skin-colored or pink."

On brown and Black skin, basal cell carcinoma often looks like a bump that's brown or glossy black and has a rolled border."
Basal cell carcinoma,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/basal-cell-carcinoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20354187,Basal cell carcinoma,Symptoms (Basal cell carcinoma),"Basal cell carcinoma usually develops on sun-exposed parts of your body, especially your head and neck. Less often, basal cell carcinoma can develop on parts of your body usually protected from the sun, such as the genitals.
Basal cell carcinoma appears as a change in the skin, such as a growth or a sore that won't heal. These changes in the skin (lesions) usually have one of the following characteristics:
* **A shiny, skin-colored bump** that's translucent, meaning you can see a bit through the surface. The bump can look pearly white or pink on white skin. On brown and Black skin, the bump often looks brown or glossy black. Tiny blood vessels might be visible, though they may be difficult to see on brown and Black skin. The bump may bleed and scab over.
* **A brown, black or blue lesion** — or a lesion with dark spots — with a slightly raised, translucent border.
* **A flat, scaly patch** with a raised edge. Over time, these patches can grow quite large.
* **A white, waxy, scar-like lesion** without a clearly defined border."

Basal cell carcinoma,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/basal-cell-carcinoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20354187,Basal cell carcinoma,Causes (Basal cell carcinoma),"Basal cell carcinoma occurs when one of the skin's basal cells develops a mutation in its DNA.
Basal cells are found at the bottom of the epidermis — the outermost layer of skin. Basal cells produce new skin cells. As new skin cells are produced, they push older cells toward the skin's surface, where the old cells die and are sloughed off."
Basal cell carcinoma,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/basal-cell-carcinoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20354187,Basal cell carcinoma,Where skin cancer develops (Basal cell carcinoma),"Skin cancer begins in the cells that make up the outer layer (epidermis) of your skin. One type of skin cancer called basal cell carcinoma begins in the basal cells, which make skin cells that continuously push older cells toward the surface. As new cells move upward, they become flattened squamous cells, where a skin cancer called squamous cell carcinoma can occur. Melanoma, another type of skin cancer, arises in the pigment cells (melanocytes).
The process of creating new skin cells is controlled by a basal cell's DNA. The DNA contains the instructions that tell a cell what to do. The mutation tells the basal cell to multiply rapidly and continue growing when it would normally die. Eventually the accumulating abnormal cells may form a cancerous tumor — the lesion that appears on the skin."
Basal cell carcinoma,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/basal-cell-carcinoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20354187,Basal cell carcinoma,Ultraviolet light and other causes (Basal cell carcinoma),"Much of the damage to DNA in basal cells is thought to result from ultraviolet (UV) radiation found in sunlight and in commercial tanning lamps and tanning beds. But sun exposure doesn't explain skin cancers that develop on skin not ordinarily exposed to sunlight. Other factors can contribute to the risk and development of basal cell carcinoma, and the exact cause may in some cases not be clear."
Basal cell carcinoma,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/basal-cell-carcinoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20354187,Basal cell carcinoma,Complications (Basal cell carcinoma),"Complications of basal cell carcinoma can include:
* **A risk of recurrence.** Basal cell carcinomas commonly recur, even after successful treatment.
* **An increased risk of other types of skin cancer.** A history of basal cell carcinoma may also increase the chance of developing other types of skin cancer, such as squamous cell carcinoma.
* **Cancer that spreads beyond the skin.** Very rarely, basal cell carcinoma can spread (metastasize) to nearby lymph nodes and other areas of the body, such as the bones and lungs."

Basal cell carcinoma,https://www.skincancer.org/skin-cancer-information/basal-cell-carcinoma,Basal Cell Carcinoma Overview,The Most Common Skin Cancer (Basal cell carcinoma),"Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most common form of skin cancer and the most frequently occurring form of all cancers. In the U.S. alone, an estimated 3.6 million cases are diagnosed each year. BCCs arise from abnormal, uncontrolled growth of basal cells.
Because BCCs grow slowly, most are curable and cause minimal damage when caught and treated early. Understanding BCC causes, risk factors and warning signs can help you detect them early, when they are easiest to treat and cure."
Basal cell carcinoma,https://www.skincancer.org/skin-cancer-information/basal-cell-carcinoma,Basal Cell Carcinoma Overview,FACT: (Basal cell carcinoma),BCC is serious and should be addressed as soon as possible.
Basal cell carcinoma,https://www.skincancer.org/skin-cancer-information/basal-cell-carcinoma,Basal Cell Carcinoma Overview,How dangerous is BCC? (Basal cell carcinoma),"BCCs rarely spread beyond the original tumor site. But these lesions can grow and become disfiguring and dangerous. Untreated BCCs can become locally invasive, grow wide and deep into the skin and destroy skin, tissue and bone. The longer you wait to get treatment, the more likely it is that the BCC will recur, sometimes repeatedly.
There are some highly unusual, aggressive cases when BCC spreads to other parts of the body. In even rarer instances, this type of BCC can become life-threatening."
Basal cell carcinoma,https://www.skincancer.org/skin-cancer-information/basal-cell-carcinoma,Basal Cell Carcinoma Overview,How widespread is BCC? (Basal cell carcinoma),"Basal cell carcinoma is quite common. The number of reported cases in the U.S. has steadily increased.
* An estimated 3.6 million Americans are diagnosed with BCC each year.
* More than one out of every three new cancers are skin cancers, and the vast majority are BCCs.

Basal cell carcinoma,https://www.msdmanuals.com/professional/dermatologic-disorders/cancers-of-the-skin/basal-cell-carcinoma,Basal Cell Carcinoma,Symptoms and Signs of Basal Cell Carcinoma,"The clinical manifestations and biologic behavior of basal cell carcinomas are highly variable.
Most commonly, the carcinoma begins as a shiny papule, enlarges slowly, and, after a few months or years, shows a shiny, pearly border with prominent engorged vessels (telangiectases) on the surface and a central dell or ulcer. Recurrent crusting or bleeding is not unusual. Commonly, the carcinomas may alternately crust and heal, which may unjustifiably decrease patient and physician concerns about the seriousness of the lesion.
There are several types of basal cell carcinomas. The most common types are
* Nodular (approximately 60% of basal cell carcinomas): These types are small, shiny, firm, almost translucent to pink nodules with telangiectases, usually on the face or other sun-exposed areas. Ulceration and crusting are common.
* Superficial (approximately 30%): These types are red or pink, marginated, thin papules or plaques, commonly on the trunk, that can be similar to psoriasis or localized dermatitis.
* Morpheaform (5 to 10%): These types are flat, scarlike, indurated plaques that can be flesh-colored or light red and have vague borders.
* Other: Other types are possible. Nodular and superficial basal cell carcinomas can produce pigment (sometimes called pigmented basal cell carcinomas).

Treatment of basal cell carcinoma should be done by a specialist.
The clinical appearance, size, site, and histologic subtype determine choice of treatment—curettage and electrodesiccation, surgical excision, cryosurgery, topical chemotherapy (imiquimod or 5-fluorouracil) and photodynamic therapy, or, occasionally, radiation therapy. The clinical appearance, size, site, and histologic subtype determine choice of treatment—curettage and electrodesiccation, surgical excision, cryosurgery, topical chemotherapy (imiquimod or 5-fluorouracil) and photodynamic therapy, or, occasionally, radiation therapy.
Recurrent or incompletely treated cancers, large cancers, cancers at high-risk or recurrence-prone sites (eg, head and neck), and morphea-like cancers with vague borders are often treated with Mohs microscopically controlled surgery, in which tissue borders are progressively excised until specimens are tumor-free (as determined by microscopic examination during surgery)."
Basal cell carcinoma,https://www.msdmanuals.com/professional/dermatologic-disorders/cancers-of-the-skin/basal-cell-carcinoma,Basal Cell Carcinoma,Prognosis for Basal Cell Carcinoma,"Basal cell carcinomas rarely metastasize but may invade healthy tissues. Rarely, patients die because the carcinoma invades or impinges on underlying vital structures or orifices (eg, eyes, ears, mouth, bone, dura mater).
Almost 25% of patients with a history of basal cell carcinoma develop a new basal cell cancer within 5 years of the original carcinoma. Consequently, patients with a history of basal cell carcinoma should be seen annually for a skin examination."
Basal cell carcinoma,https://www.msdmanuals.com/professional/dermatologic-disorders/cancers-of-the-skin/basal-cell-carcinoma,Basal Cell Carcinoma,Prevention of Basal Cell Carcinoma,"Because basal cell carcinoma is associated with ultraviolet (UV) exposure, a number of measures are recommended to limit exposure.
* Sun avoidance: Seeking shade, minimizing outdoor activities between 10 AM and 4 PM (when sun's rays are strongest), and avoiding sunbathing and the use of tanning beds
* Use of protective clothing: Long-sleeved shirts, pants, and broad-brimmed hats
* Use of sunscreen: At least sun protection factor (SPF) 30 with broad-spectrum UVA/UVB protection, used as directed (ie, reapplied every 2 hours and after swimming or sweating); should not be used to prolong sun exposure"

* Consider the diagnosis with typical lesions (eg, shiny, slowly enlarging papule, often with a shiny, pearly border) and lesions that bleed easily or alternately crust and heal.
* Refer patients to specialists for treatment, usually by locally destructive methods.

* Usually, a small, shiny bump appears on the skin and enlarges slowly.
* The bumps may break open and form a scab, sometimes with bleeding, or become flat, resembling a scar.
* This cancer can often be identified by sight, but doctors usually do a biopsy.
* The cancer is usually removed, but sometimes people may be given chemotherapy drugs applied to the skin, immunotherapy, or, occasionally, radiation therapy or medications taken by mouth.

Basal cells are in the lowest layer of the epidermis (the outer layer of the skin). Although basal cell carcinoma may not develop from the basal cells, the disease is so named because the cancer cells look like basal cells under a microscope.
Basal cell carcinoma is most common among people who have light skin and a history of sun exposure. It is very rare among people with dark skin.
Basal cell carcinoma usually develops on skin surfaces that are exposed to sunlight, commonly on the head or neck, and may develop in a type of birthmark that often appears on the scalp (nevus sebaceus). Basal cell carcinoma also may develop in people who have certain hereditary disorders, such as xeroderma pigmentosum, Gorlin syndrome, and Bazex syndrome.
The tumors enlarge very slowly, sometimes so slowly that they go unnoticed as new growths. However, the growth rate varies greatly from tumor to tumor, with some growing as much as ½ inch (about 1 centimeter) in a year.
Basal cell carcinomas rarely spread (metastasize) to other parts of the body. Instead, they invade and slowly destroy surrounding tissues. When basal cell carcinomas grow near the eyes, ears, mouth, bone, or brain, the consequences of spread can be serious and can lead to death. Yet, for most people, the tumors simply grow slowly into the skin."
Basal cell carcinoma,https://www.msdmanuals.com/home/skin-disorders/skin-cancers/basal-cell-carcinoma,Basal Cell Carcinoma,Symptoms of Basal Cell Carcinoma,"There are several types of basal cell carcinomas.
The nodular type of basal cell carcinoma usually begins as small, shiny, firm, almost clear to pink in color, raised growth. After a few months or years, visible dilated blood vessels (telangiectases) may appear on the surface, and the center may break open and form a scab. The border of the cancer is sometimes thickened and pearly white. The cancer may alternately bleed and form a scab and heal, leading a person to falsely think that it is a sore rather than a cancer.
Other types of basal cell carcinomas vary greatly in appearance. For example, the superficial type appears as flat, thin, red or pink patches, and the morpheaform type appears as thicker flesh-colored or light red patches that look somewhat like scars.

Basal cell carcinoma,https://www.health.harvard.edu/a_to_z/basal-cell-carcinoma-a-to-z,Basal cell carcinoma,What is basal cell carcinoma?,"Basal cell cancer is the most common form of skin cancer diagnosed in the United States.
Basal cells are small, round skin cells normally found in the upper part of your skin. When these cells become cancerous, they usually turn into small skin tumors that can destroy skin and nearby tissues. They can grow large over time, causing damage around and under them. Basal cell tumors rarely spread beyond the original cancer site.
Basal cell cancer can grow on any part of the body. However, most basal cell cancers are found on some part of the face. This can cause disfigurement, and can interfere with the function of the eyelids, nose, and mouth.
---
Basal cell cancer often develops because of repeated, long-term exposure to the sun. People with light skin and blue eyes are at particularly high risk. Less often, basal cell cancer may be caused by exposure to arsenic or certain industrial pollutants. Older people who received X-ray treatment for acne as teenagers are at higher risk of developing basal cell cancer."
Basal cell carcinoma,https://www.health.harvard.edu/a_to_z/basal-cell-carcinoma-a-to-z,Basal cell carcinoma,Symptoms of basal cell carcinoma,"Basal cell skin cancer usually appears as a tiny, painless bump with a pink, pearly surface. As the cancer slowly grows, the center of the bump may become sore and develop into a crater that bleeds, crusts, or forms a scab.
---
A rare type of basal cell cancer may look like a small scar.
Although it is commonly located on the face, basal cell cancer can develop on the ears, back, neck and other skin surfaces frequently exposed to the sun."
Basal cell carcinoma,https://www.health.harvard.edu/a_to_z/basal-cell-carcinoma-a-to-z,Basal cell carcinoma,Diagnosing basal cell carcinoma,"Your doctor will examine your skin. He or she will do a biopsy, which involves removing skin so it can be examined in a laboratory. The doctor may remove some, or all, of the abnormal skin for the biopsy."
Basal cell carcinoma,https://www.health.harvard.edu/a_to_z/basal-cell-carcinoma-a-to-z,Basal cell carcinoma,Expected duration of basal cell carcinoma,"Once a basal cell cancer develops on the skin, it usually grows slowly. It can become very large, especially if it is on your lower back, the back of your shoulder or some other area that you do not usually see in the mirror."
Basal cell carcinoma,https://www.health.harvard.edu/a_to_z/basal-cell-carcinoma-a-to-z,Basal cell carcinoma,Preventing basal cell carcinoma,"Unprotected exposure to sunlight increases your risk of developing basal cell cancer. You can help to reduce this risk in several ways:
* Apply sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of 30 or higher before you go outdoors.
* Limit your time outdoors when the sun is at its peak (in most parts of the United States, from about 10 a.m. to 3 p.m.).
* Wear sunglasses with ultraviolet light protection.
* Wear long pants, a shirt with long sleeves and a hat with a wide brim.
* Be aware that some drugs may increase your skin's risk of damage from the sun. These include certain antibiotics, and drugs used to treat psychiatric illness, high blood pressure, heart failure, acne and allergies. If you take prescription medications, ask your doctor if you need to take extra precautions to limit sun exposure.
* Be aware that some skin care products can make your skin more vulnerable to damage from sunlight. These include products containing alpha-hydroxy acids.

If a basal cell cancer develops on your skin, early detection may limit damage. Examine your skin thoroughly every one to two months. Use a mirror to check your skin on less visible areas, such as your back, shoulders, upper arms, buttocks and the soles of your feet."
Basal cell carcinoma,https://www.health.harvard.edu/a_to_z/basal-cell-carcinoma-a-to-z,Basal cell carcinoma,When to call a professional (Basal cell carcinoma),"Call your doctor or a dermatologist (a doctor who specializes in skin problems) if you notice:
* A pearly nodule on your skin
* A new skin growth
* A skin ulcer that does not heal."
Basal cell carcinoma,https://www.health.harvard.edu/a_to_z/basal-cell-carcinoma-a-to-z,Basal cell carcinoma,Prognosis (Basal cell carcinoma),The outlook is usually excellent. Most basal cell cancers are cured if they are treated early.

Basal cell carcinoma,https://www.dermnetnz.org/topics/basal-cell-carcinoma,**Basal cell carcinoma**,How is basal cell carcinoma diagnosed?,Some typical superficial BCCs on trunk and limbs are clinically diagnosed and have non-surgical treatment without histology.
Basal cell carcinoma,https://www.dermnetnz.org/topics/basal-cell-carcinoma,**Basal cell carcinoma**,What is the treatment for primary basal cell carcinoma?,"The treatment for a BCC depends on its type, size and location, the number to be treated, patient factors, and the preference or expertise of the doctor. Most BCCs are treated surgically. Long-term follow-up is recommended to check for new lesions and recurrence; the latter may be unnecessary if histology has reported wide clear margins."
Basal cell carcinoma,https://www.dermnetnz.org/topics/basal-cell-carcinoma,**Basal cell carcinoma**,Excision biopsy (Basal cell carcinoma),"* Most appropriate treatment for nodular, infiltrative and morphoeic BCCs.
* Should include 3 to 5 mm margin of normal skin around the tumour.

Pyogenic granulomas and hemorrhage,https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/22717-pyogenic-granuloma,Pyogenic Granuloma,What causes pyogenic granuloma? (Pyogenic granulomas and hemorrhage),"The exact cause of pyogenic granulomas is unknown.
They often happen along with:
* Minor injury or irritation to your skin or mucous membranes (such as poor oral hygiene or piercings).

The skin condition has also been linked to the use of certain types of medications, including:
* Retinoids (vitamin A compounds often used to improve or heal skin)."
Pyogenic granulomas and hemorrhage,https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/22717-pyogenic-granuloma,Pyogenic Granuloma,Where do pyogenic granulomas occur? (Pyogenic granulomas and hemorrhage),"They can appear anywhere on your skin or mucous membranes. Mucous membranes are thin linings of cavities and canals that leave your body. Examples include the lining of your mouth and nose.
Common sites for pyogenic granulomas are:
* Face.
* Mouth (gums), lips, tongue or nose.
* Fingers and toes."
Pyogenic granulomas and hemorrhage,https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/22717-pyogenic-granuloma,Pyogenic Granuloma,What does a pyogenic granuloma look like? (Pyogenic granulomas and hemorrhage),"A pyogenic granuloma starts as a small, fleshy bump protruding from your skin or mucous membranes. It usually grows quickly, from a few millimeters (the tip of a crayon) to about a half-inch (the tip of a finger).
Pyogenic granulomas have been described as looking like ground beef. They may be pink, red, reddish-brown or purple. They often develop a scaly, white “collar” around the bottom.
At maturity, the growths are often attached to your skin by a stalk-like structure (pedunculated). But they can also attach directly to your skin (sessile).
The surface of a pyogenic granuloma starts smooth but can become bumpy or crusty. The lesions are delicate, so they ooze, break and bleed easily."
Pyogenic granulomas and hemorrhage,https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/22717-pyogenic-granuloma,Pyogenic Granuloma,Are pyogenic granulomas contagious? (Pyogenic granulomas and hemorrhage),"Pyogenic granulomas aren’t contagious. Most people get only one pyogenic granuloma at a time, but sometimes, several appear at once."
Pyogenic granulomas and hemorrhage,https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/22717-pyogenic-granuloma,Pyogenic Granuloma,How is a pyogenic granuloma diagnosed? (Pyogenic granulomas and hemorrhage),"To diagnose lobular capillary hemangioma, your healthcare provider will:
* Ask about any injury or irritation to the area.
* Examine your skin or mucous membrane.
* Inquire whether you’re pregnant.
* Review all medications you’re taking."
Pyogenic granulomas and hemorrhage,https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/22717-pyogenic-granuloma,Pyogenic Granuloma,How do you get rid of pyogenic granulomas? (Pyogenic granulomas and hemorrhage),"Your healthcare provider may recommend a medication or procedure to treat pyogenic granulomas.
Topical medications applied to your skin to shrink pyogenic granulomas include:
* Imiquimod skin cream.

Procedures that can remove granulomas include:
* Curettage, to scrape it away, and cautery, to seal the skin with heat.
* Laser treatment to destroy the abnormal tissue.
* Surgical excision, to cut the granuloma out of your skin.

Care at Cleveland Clinic"
Pyogenic granulomas and hemorrhage,https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/22717-pyogenic-granuloma,Pyogenic Granuloma,How can I reduce my risk of pyogenic granuloma? (Pyogenic granulomas and hemorrhage),"Scientists don’t fully understand what causes pyogenic granuloma, but the condition is linked to certain things. As such, the following strategies may reduce your risk:
* Avoid medications that are associated with the condition.
* Don’t injure your skin (with piercings, for example).
* Wash and bandage any cuts, scrapes and burns to prevent infection."
Pyogenic granulomas and hemorrhage,https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/22717-pyogenic-granuloma,Pyogenic Granuloma,What can I expect if I have a pyogenic granuloma? (Pyogenic granulomas and hemorrhage),The prognosis (outlook) is good with pyogenic granuloma. Lesions associated with pregnancy typically go away on their own. Other types usually require treatment but respond well.
Pyogenic granulomas and hemorrhage,https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/22717-pyogenic-granuloma,Pyogenic Granuloma,Can you get a pyogenic granuloma multiple times? (Pyogenic granulomas and hemorrhage),"Even after successful treatment, you can develop another pyogenic granuloma in the same area or elsewhere on your body. According to some studies, the recurrence rate can be as high as 40%."
Pyogenic granulomas and hemorrhage,https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/22717-pyogenic-granuloma,Pyogenic Granuloma,How do I take care of a pyogenic granuloma? (Pyogenic granulomas and hemorrhage),"Most people with pyogenic granulomas should seek treatment. If you don’t seek treatment, keep the growth covered with a bandage to prevent bleeding and infection.
Contact your healthcare provider if you develop any signs of a skin infection, such as:
* Increasing pain or tenderness on or near the lesion.
* Pus draining from the area.
* Red or brown streaks on your skin.
* Swelling near the lesion."
Pyogenic granulomas and hemorrhage,https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/22717-pyogenic-granuloma,Pyogenic Granuloma,A note from Cleveland Clinic (Pyogenic granulomas and hemorrhage),"A pyogenic granuloma is a noncancerous, raised tumor on your skin or mucous membranes. The lesions consist of abnormal blood vessels, and they break and bleed easily. If you have a pyogenic granuloma, talk to your healthcare provider about medications and procedures that can help."

(Pyogenic granulomas and hemorrhage),"Pyogenic granuloma of the skin presents as a painless red fleshy nodule, typically 5-10mm in diameter, that grows rapidly over a few weeks. The surface is initially smooth but can ulcerate, become crusty, or verrucous. Pyogenic granuloma is usually solitary, but multiple nodules and satellite lesions can erupt. The most common sites involved are the fingers and face. Pyogenic granuloma easily bleeds with minor trauma.
Oral mucosal pyogenic granulomas typically develop on the lip and gums (gingiva) as pedunculated or sessile slow-growing painless red papules ranging in size from a few millimetres to several centimetres. The surface can be ulcerated with a yellow-fibrinous surface, and easy bleeding. With time, the lesion becomes a paler pink colour. Other mucosal sites that can be affected include the conjunctiva and nasal mucosa.

Pyogenic granulomas and hemorrhage,https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1084701-overview,Pyogenic Granuloma (Lobular Capillary Hemangioma),Background (Pyogenic granulomas and hemorrhage),"The lesion usually occurs in children and young adults as a solitary glistening red papule or nodule that is prone to bleeding and ulceration. Pyogenic granulomas typically evolve rapidly over a period of a few weeks, most often on the head, neck, extremities, and upper trunk.
Other pyogenic granuloma variants that have been well documented include the following subtypes:
* Disseminated
* Subcutaneous
* Intravenous (IV)
* Medication-induced (eg, by retinoid, antiretroviral, or oncologic agents)

Removal of pyogenic granuloma is indicated to alleviate any bleeding, discomfort, cosmetic distress, and diagnostic uncertainty. A number of malignant tumors may clinically mimic pyogenic granuloma, making histopathologic confirmation important if the presentation is atypical.

Pyogenic Granuloma (Palm)
Pyogenic Granuloma (Lip)
Pyogenic Granuloma (Shoulder)
Pyogenic Granuloma (Nail)
The lesion, composed of vascular tissue, is neither of bacterial origin nor a true granuloma. It develops rapidly, often at the site of recent injury (although injury may not be recalled), typically grows no larger than 2 cm in diameter, and probably represents a vascular and fibrous response to injury. There is no sex or age predilection.
The overlying epidermis is thin, and the lesion tends to be friable, bleeds easily, and does not blanch on pressure. The base may be pedunculated and surrounded by a collarette of epidermis.
During pregnancy, pyogenic granulomas may become large and exuberant (called gingival pregnancy tumors or telangiectatic epulis).
Examples of Pyogenic Granulomas

Patients with balanitis often present with penile pain, swelling, and erythema of the glans. Balanoposthitis describes the same condition that also involves the foreskin. Recurrent episodes are suggestive of diabetes. Balanitis and balanoposthitis are primarily infectious in origin, with _Candida_ being the most common etiologic organism. Phimosis increases the risk of balanitis, whereas circumcision significantly decreases the risk. Treatment of balanitis typically involves topical antifungals, which can be augmented by topical corticosteroids and oral antifungals.

Balanitis is not considered an STI. The condition itself is not transferable from one person to another, but the organisms that cause balanitis can be transferred. Recurrent episodes of balanoposthitis should raise concern for occult diabetes, so patients with recurrent episodes should undergo blood glucose testing. The morbidity of balanitis arises from prolonged patient discomfort if left untreated, symptoms from complications such as phimosis, and delayed diagnosis of an STI, penile intraepithelial neoplasia, or penile cancer."

However, the most common cause of balanitis is poor or inadequate personal hygiene in uncircumcised males, leading to candidal infection.
Infectious etiologies of balanitis include:
* Anaerobic and aerobic bacteria such as _Bacteroides_ ,  _Streptococcus_ , and  _Staphylococcus_
*  _Borrelia vincentii_ and _Borrelia burgdorferi_
*  _Candida_ species (most commonly associated with diabetes)
* _Chlamydia_ species
* _Gardnerella vaginalis_
* Group B and group A beta-hemolytic streptococci
*  _Human herpesvirus 1_ and _2_
* Human papillomaviruses
* _Neisseria _gonorrhoeae__
* Scabies
*  _Treponema pallidum_ ,the etiologic agent of syphilis
*  _Trichomonas_ species.

Noninfectious etiologies of balanitis include:
* Allergic reactions to condom latex and contraceptive jelly
* Autodigestion by activated pancreatic transplant exocrine enzymes
* Chemical irritants, such as spermicides, detergents, perfumed soaps and shower gels, fabric conditioners, and petroleum jelly
* Cirrhosis
* Drug allergies, such as tetracycline, sulfonamide, phenacetin, spermicides, and personal lubricants
* Eczema
* Edematous conditions, including right-sided heart failure, cirrhosis, anasarca, and nephrotic syndrome
* Fixed-drug eruptions, such as those due to sulfa and tetracycline

Pyogenic granulomas and hemorrhage,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK537143/,"[Bookshelf](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/ ""Bookshelf home"")",Epidemiology (Pyogenic granulomas and hemorrhage),"Balanitis can occur at any age, affecting approximately 1 in every 25 boys and 1 in 30 uncircumcised men during their lifetime. Boys younger than 4 years and uncircumcised men are the highest-risk groups. Balanitis accounts for approximately 11% of all male patients treated by urologists in the United States. Globally, about 3% of all uncircumcised men are affected.
Balanitis is more likely to occur if there is phimosis, a condition where a tight foreskin cannot retract back over the glans penis. When boys reach approximately 5, the foreskin becomes easy to retract, and the risk of balanitis decreases.
Risk factors for balanitis include:
* Use of condom catheters
* Contact allergic responses
* Edematous conditions, such as heart failure, nephrosis, anasarca, and cirrhosis
* Failing to retract the foreskin
* Immunocompromised state
* Morbid obesity
* Nursing home environment
* Overwashing
* Penile trauma
* Phimosis
* Poor personal hygiene
* Reactive arthritis
* Sensitivity to common chemicals, such as soaps and lubricants
* STIs
* Unauthorized application of topical treatments to the glans
* Uncircumcised state

Pyogenic granulomas and hemorrhage,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK537143/,"[Bookshelf](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/ ""Bookshelf home"")",Pathophysiology (Pyogenic granulomas and hemorrhage),"Balanitis is most common in uncircumcised males due to poor hygiene and the accumulation of smegma beneath the foreskin. Smegma is a soft, thick, cheesy, whitish substance composed of shed skin cells, sweat, and sebaceous oils (sebum), which typically collects under the foreskin in uncircumcised males. Although smegma has an unpleasant odor, it is usually harmless if regularly cleaned from the glans; however, it can become infected in cases of balanitis.
In some cases, dermatologic conditions, such as psoriasis, lichen planus, or lichen sclerosus; allergic reactions; or, less likely, premalignant conditions may be responsible. Suspicion of an underlying malignancy warrants a diagnostic or excisional biopsy. Clinical findings on physical examination may point to other etiologies that can have management implications."

Microscopically, the appearance is typically nonspecific inflammation with increased lymphocytes, plasma cells, and macrophages. Epithelial changes associated with inflammation, such as squamous hyperplasia and ulcerations, may also be found. Histological signs of malignancy are not present."
Pyogenic granulomas and hemorrhage,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK537143/,"[Bookshelf](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/ ""Bookshelf home"")",Evaluation (Pyogenic granulomas and hemorrhage),"Men with suspected balanitis often complain of penile pain, itchiness, redness, and difficulty retracting the foreskin. There may be dysuria or difficulty with voiding, a foul odor, ulcerations, plaques, meatal stenosis, inguinal lymphadenopathy, or ballooning of the foreskin during micturition, indicating phimosis.
One of the primary goals in the evaluation and management of balanitis is to exclude STIs, minimize problems with urinary and sexual function, and exclude cancer of the penis. All patients presenting with balanitis should be considered for STI screening, including blood tests for syphilis, HIV, and HPV, and screening for diabetes. Any discharge should be cultured. A potassium hydroxide test can be performed to identify _Candida._
The presence of penile ulcers or vesicles does not rule out balanitis, although these findings suggest HSV or syphilis, respectively.
There are some similarities between balanitis and squamous carcinoma of the penis. Both conditions are more likely to appear in older, uncircumcised males who exhibit poor genital hygiene and have a foul-smelling discharge, phimosis, and a rash or color change on the glans or foreskin. However, penile cancer is typically characterized by painless bleeding, a specific growth or distinct ulcer on the genitalia, and a lack of response to topical balanitis treatments.
Typically, the failure of a 4-week course of standard balanitis therapy or rapid growth despite treatment suggests a diagnosis of penile carcinoma."

In such cases, cultures should be obtained, and a tissue biopsy should be considered.
In some cases, gentle dilation of a tight foreskin with a clamp may be attempted, but this can damage the hidden glans and urethra underneath and is contraindicated if there are penile adhesions between the glans and foreskin. This procedure typically requires sedation or local anesthesia.
There are several specific types of balanitis:"
Pyogenic granulomas and hemorrhage,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK537143/,"[Bookshelf](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/ ""Bookshelf home"")",Complications (Pyogenic granulomas and hemorrhage),"Complications associated with balanitis include pain, ulcerative lesions of the glans or foreskin, phimosis, paraphimosis, meatal or urethral stricture, and the malignant transformation of premalignant lesions.
Phimosis is an abnormal constriction of the foreskin opening that precludes retraction over the glans penis caused by chronic inflammation and edema of the foreskin. The development of phimosis often complicates sexual function, voiding, and personal hygiene. If the patient or medical staff forcibly retracts the foreskin, paraphimosis (trapping of the foreskin behind the glans) can occur, requiring urgent surgical intervention.
Penile cellulitis, meatal stenosis, and balanoposthitis are additional potential complications."

They should be advised on proper hygiene and the importance of informing members of their healthcare team about any lesions or abnormalities, even if they are asymptomatic. Regular physical examinations can help reduce any embarrassment over time, especially when the importance of these inspections is consistently emphasized and repeated by the entire healthcare team."

A distinct growth or ulcer on the foreskin or glans, easy bleeding, and failure of initial balanitis therapy should indicate the need to consider a diagnosis of penile carcinoma and suggest a possible biopsy or excision.
If there is uncertainty about the diagnosis, such as a lesion not responding to standard therapy, a biopsy should be considered, or the patient should be referred to a specialist with more experience. The complications and morbidity of delaying a diagnosis of penile carcinoma significantly outweigh the relatively mild and minimal adverse effects of an early biopsy. There are also potential medico-legal implications."
Pyogenic granulomas and hemorrhage,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK537143/,"[Bookshelf](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/ ""Bookshelf home"")",Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes (Pyogenic granulomas and hemorrhage),"Healthcare workers and nurse practitioners should be aware of common skin disorders that affect the penis as they are common, easily prevented, and often quite uncomfortable for the patient. Caregivers should be aware that many male patients are embarrassed to mention penile problems, particularly to female healthcare workers. Nevertheless, routine examinations of this anatomy are essential to identify correctable problems early and institute proper hygiene procedures, particularly in older uncircumcised diabetics.
Management of balanitis without an identifiable cause initially focuses on implementing local hygiene measures. In addition, it warrants empiric treatment for candidal infection and the need to implement additional hygienic measures. Retraction of the foreskin with thorough but gentle genital cleansing can be both preventive and therapeutic. The suggestion is to bathe the affected area twice daily with a saline solution. In uncircumcised males, nonspecific balanitis may respond to saline solution bathing alone."

Pyogenic granulomas and hemorrhage,https://www.healthline.com/health/pyogenic-granuloma,Pyogenic Granuloma,Large pyogenic granulomas (Pyogenic granulomas and hemorrhage),"If you have a bigger growth, your doctor will most likely shave it off and lightly cauterize or burn it. Cauterizing helps stop bleeding and can reduce the risk of it growing back.
Alternatively, your doctor might apply a chemical, such as silver nitrate, to the pyogenic granuloma to help with the bleeding.
These growths can also be removed using laser surgery.
Don’t pick at the granulomas or try to remove them on your own. They tend to bleed for a long time, so having a doctor remove them with proper instruments and cautery tools is a must."

Long-term outlook
Pyogenic granulomas are always benign, but it’s normal to be a little concerned, especially if the nodule is bleeding. They can also be a cosmetic concern for some people. Talk to your doctor about any concerns you have. They can make sure the growth is benign and start discussing your treatment options with you.
While uncommon, some pyogenic granulomas may shrink and resolve on their own after time, particularly if the cause was related to pregnancy or a certain medication. In these cases, no removal procedure is necessary. However, most pyogenic granulomas will need some sort of procedure to treat and remove them."

Hives — also known as urticaria (ur-tih-KAR-e-uh) — is a skin reaction that causes itchy welts that range in size from small spots to large blotches. Hives can be triggered by many situations and substances, including certain foods and medications.
Angioedema can arise with hives or alone. It causes swelling in the deeper layers of skin, often around the face and lips. Short-lived (acute) hives and angioedema are common. Most times, they are harmless, clear up within in a day and don't leave any lasting marks, even without treatment. Hives that last longer than six weeks are called chronic hives.
Hives and angioedema are usually treated with antihistamine medication. Angioedema can be life-threatening if swelling of the tongue or in the throat blocks the airway."

* **Drugs for hereditary angioedema.** If you have the type of angioedema that runs in families, you may take medication to relieve symptoms and keep the levels of certain proteins in your blood at levels that do not cause symptoms.
* **Anti-inflammatory drugs.** For severe hives or angioedema, doctors may prescribe a short course of an oral corticosteroid drug — such as prednisone — to reduce swelling, inflammation and itching."

* **Avoid triggers.** These can include foods, medications, pollen, pet dander, latex and insect stings. If you think a medication caused your rash, stop using it and contact your primary care provider. Some studies suggest that stress or fatigue can trigger hives.
* **Use an anti-itch drug available without a prescription.** A nonprescription oral antihistamine, such as loratadine (Alavert, Claritin, others), cetirizine (Zyrtec Allergy, others) or diphenhydramine (Benadryl Allergy, others), may help relieve itching. Consider whether you might prefer a type that doesn't cause drowsiness. Ask your pharmacist about options.
* **Apply cold.** Covering the affected area with a cold washcloth or rubbing an ice cube over it for a few minutes can help soothe the skin and prevent scratching.
* **Take a comfortably cool bath.** Find relief from itching in a cool shower or bath. Some people may also benefit from bathing in cool water sprinkled with baking soda or oatmeal powder (Aveeno, others), but this isn't a solution for long-term control of chronic itching.
* **Wear loose, smooth-textured cotton clothing.** Avoid wearing clothing that's rough, tight, scratchy or made from wool.
* **Protect your skin from the sun.** Apply sunscreen liberally about a half hour before going outdoors. When outdoors, seek shade to help relieve discomfort."

* List your signs and symptoms, when they occurred, and how long they lasted.
* List any medications you're taking, including vitamins, herbs and supplements. Even better, take the original bottles and a list of the doses and directions.
* List questions to ask your doctor.

For hives and angioedema, questions you may want to ask include:
* What is likely causing my symptoms?
* Do I need any tests to confirm the diagnosis?
* What are other possible causes for my symptoms?
* Is my condition likely temporary or chronic?
* What is the best course of action?
* What are the alternatives to the primary approach that you're suggesting?
* Do I need prescription medication, or can I use nonprescription medications to treat the condition?
* What results can I expect?
* Can I wait to see if the condition goes away on its own?"

(Actinic keratoses and intraepithelial carcinomae),"Actinic keratoses affect people that have often lived in the tropics or subtropics and have predisposing factors such as:
* History of long hours spent outdoors for work or recreation
* Defective immune system.

However, even in temperate climates they may be common - in southern Ireland and northwest England up to 25% of people aged 60 years and over have at least one."
Actinic keratoses and intraepithelial carcinomae,https://dermnetnz.org/topics/actinic-keratosis,**Actinic keratosis**,What causes actinic keratoses? (Actinic keratoses and intraepithelial carcinomae),Actinic keratoses are the result of abnormal skin cell development due to DNA damage by short wavelength UVB.
Actinic keratoses and intraepithelial carcinomae,https://dermnetnz.org/topics/actinic-keratosis,**Actinic keratosis**,What are the clinical features of actinic keratosis? (Actinic keratoses and intraepithelial carcinomae),"Actinic keratosis may be solitary but there are often multiple keratoses. The appearance varies.
* A flat or thickened papule, or plaque
* White or yellow; scaly, warty, or horny surface
* Skin coloured, red, or pigmented
* Tender or asymptomatic

They are sometimes graded according to their appearance:
Grade 1: Mild pink or grey marks with slight scale and gritty to touch
Grade 2: Moderate thicker hyperkeratosis and easily detected
Grade 3: Severe hyperkeratotic thick keratin
Grade 4: Confluent areas several centimetres with a range of the above grades of AK
Actinic keratoses are very common on sites repeatedly exposed to the sun, especially the backs of the hands and the face, most often affecting the ears, nose, cheeks, upper lip, vermilion of the lower lip, temples, forehead, and balding scalp. In severely chronically sun-damaged individuals, they may also be found on the upper trunk, upper and lower limbs, and dorsum of feet.

Actinic keratoses and intraepithelial carcinomae,https://dermnetnz.org/topics/actinic-keratosis,**Actinic keratosis**,What is the treatment for actinic keratoses? (Actinic keratoses and intraepithelial carcinomae),"Actinic keratoses are usually removed because they are unsightly or uncomfortable, or because of the risk that skin cancer may develop in them. The latter point is a matter of considerable debate, and the most robust studies (Cochrane review) did not find convincing evidence that AK treatment resulted in a prevention of invasive squamous cell carcinomas.
Treatment of an actinic keratosis requires removal of the defective skin cells. Epidermis regenerates from surrounding or follicular keratinocytes that have escaped sun damage. Some AKs will resolve with the frequent and appropriate use of sunscreens.
Tender, thickened, ulcerated, or enlarging actinic keratoses should be treated aggressively. Asymptomatic flat keratoses may not require active treatment but should be kept under observation."

(Actinic keratoses and intraepithelial carcinomae),"Intraepidermal SCC is derived from squamous cells, the flat epidermal cells that make keratin, the horny protein that makes up skin, hair and nails. ‘Intraepidermal’ and ‘in situ’ mean the malignant cells are confined to the tissue of origin, in this case, the epidermis."

* Sun exposure: intraepidermal SCC is most often found in sun-damaged individuals.
* Ionising radiation: intraepidermal SCC was common on unprotected hands of radiologists early in the 20th century.
* Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection: this is implicated in intraepidermal SCC on fingers and fingernails."

(Actinic keratoses and intraepithelial carcinomae),"Ultraviolet radiation (UV) is the main cause of intraepidermal SCC. It damages the skin cell nucleic acids (DNA), resulting in a mutant clone of the gene _p53,_ setting off uncontrolled growth of the skin cells. UV also suppresses the immune response, preventing recovery from damage.
Human papillomavirus (HPV) is another major cause of intraepidermal SCC. Oncogenic strains of HPV are the main cause of squamous intraepithelial lesions (SIL), that is, squamous cell carcinoma in situ in mucosal tissue."

Dermatofibroma,https://dermnetnz.org/topics/dermatofibroma,**Dermatofibroma**,What is a dermatofibroma?,"A dermatofibroma is a common benign fibrous nodule usually found on the skin of the lower legs.
A dermatofibroma is also called a cutaneous fibrous histiocytoma."
Dermatofibroma,https://dermnetnz.org/topics/dermatofibroma,**Dermatofibroma**,Who gets a dermatofibroma?,"Dermatofibromas are mostly seen in adults. People of every ethnicity can develop dermatofibromas. Ordinary dermatofibromas are more common in women than in men, although some histologic variants are more commonly identified in males."
Dermatofibroma,https://dermnetnz.org/topics/dermatofibroma,**Dermatofibroma**,What causes dermatofibroma?,"It is not clear if dermatofibroma is a reactive process or a true neoplasm. The lesions are composed of proliferating fibroblasts. Histiocytes may also be involved.
They are sometimes attributed to minor trauma including insect bites, injections, or a rose thorn injury, but not consistently. Multiple dermatofibromas can develop in patients with altered immunity such as HIV, immunosuppression, or autoimmune conditions."
Dermatofibroma,https://dermnetnz.org/topics/dermatofibroma,**Dermatofibroma**,What are the clinical features of dermatofibroma?,"A dermatofibroma usually presents as a solitary firm papule or nodule on a limb.
* A dermatofibroma can occur anywhere on the skin.
* Dermatofibroma size varies from 0.5–1.5 cm diameter; most lesions are 7–10 mm diameter.
* A dermatofibroma is tethered to the skin surface and mobile over subcutaneous tissue.
* The overlying skin dimples on pinching the lesion – the dimple or pinch sign.
* Colour may be pink to light brown in white skin, and dark brown to black in dark skin; some appear paler in the centre.
* Dermatofibromas do not usually cause symptoms, but they are sometimes painful, tender, or itchy.

Clinical variants include giant, eruptive, and multiple forms.

Dermatofibroma,https://dermnetnz.org/topics/dermatofibroma,**Dermatofibroma**,What are the complications of dermatofibroma?,"Because dermatofibromas are often raised lesions, they may be traumatised, for example by a razor.
Occasionally dozens may erupt within a few months, usually in the setting of immunosuppression."

Dermatofibroma,https://dermnetnz.org/topics/dermatofibroma,**Dermatofibroma**,What is the treatment for dermatofibroma?,"A dermatofibroma is harmless and seldom causes any symptoms. Usually, only reassurance is needed. If it is nuisance or causing concern, the lesion can be removed surgically. Recurrence is common as the lesion often extends beyond the clinical margin."

Dermatofibroma,https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003051.htm,Stuffy or runny nose - children,Considerations (Dermatofibroma),"Expand Section
Most of the time, nasal congestion in older children and adolescents is not serious by itself, but can cause other problems.
When nasal stuffiness is just on one side, the child may have inserted something into the nose.
Nasal congestion can interfere with the ears, hearing, and speech development. Congestion that is very bad may interfere with sleep."
Dermatofibroma,https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003051.htm,Stuffy or runny nose - children,Causes (Dermatofibroma),"Expand Section
A stuffy or runny nose may be caused by:
* Sinus infection

The congestion typically goes away by itself within a week.
Congestion also can be caused by:
* Use of some nasal sprays or drops bought without a prescription for more than 3 days (may make nasal stuffiness worse)
* Nasal polyps, sac-like growths of inflamed tissue lining the nose or sinuses
* Pregnancy
* Vasomotor rhinitis
* Small objects in the nostril"
Dermatofibroma,https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003051.htm,Stuffy or runny nose - children,Home Care (Dermatofibroma),"Expand Section
Tips to help infants and younger children include:
* Raise the head of your child's bed. Put a pillow underneath the head of the mattress. Or, place books or boards under the legs at the head of the bed.
* Older children may drink extra fluids, but those fluids should be sugar-free.
* You can try a cool-mist vaporizer, but avoid putting too much moisture in the room. Clean the vaporizer every day with bleach or a disinfectant cleaning product.
* You can also steam up the bathroom shower and bring your child in there before bed.

A nasal wash can help remove mucus from your child's nose.
* You can buy a saline spray at a drugstore or make one at home. To make one, use 1 cup (240 milliliters) of warm water, 1/2 teaspoon (3 grams) of salt, and a pinch of baking soda.
* Use gentle saline nasal sprays 3 to 4 times per day.

If your child has allergies:
* Your health care provider may also prescribe nasal sprays that treat allergy symptoms.

Nasal sprays are not recommended for children under age 2. Don't use over-the-counter nasal sprays more often than 3 days on and 3 days off, unless told to by your provider.
You can buy cough and cold medicines without a prescription. They do not seem to be effective in children."
Dermatofibroma,https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003051.htm,Stuffy or runny nose - children,When to Contact a Medical Professional (Dermatofibroma),"Expand Section
Contact the provider if your child has any of the following:
* A stuffy nose with swelling of the forehead, eyes, side of the nose, or cheek, or that occurs with blurred vision
* More throat pain, or white or yellow spots on the tonsils or other parts of the throat
* Discharge from the nose that has a bad smell, comes from only one side, or is a color other than white or yellow
* Cough that lasts longer than 10 days, or produces yellow-green or gray mucus
* Symptoms that last more than 3 weeks
* Nasal discharge with fever"

Dermatofibroma,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK549820/,"[Bookshelf](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/ ""Bookshelf home"")",Introduction (Dermatofibroma),"Glycogen, also known as animal starch, is a branched polysaccharide that serves as a reserve of carbohydrates in the body; it is stored in the liver and muscle and readily available as an immediate energy source. The formation of glycogen from glucose is known as glycogenesis, and the breakdown of glycogen to form glucose is called glycogen metabolism or glycogenolysis. Increased cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) catalyzes the breakdown of glycogen (glycogenolysis). The primary hormones that regulate the cycle of glycogenesis and gluconeogenesis are insulin, glucagon, and cortisol. Glycogenolysis is initiated by the action of a specific enzyme called phosphorylase, which yields glucose-1-phosphate (P). Glucose-1-P is an essential compound at the intersection of several metabolic pathways, such as glycolysis, glycogenesis, glycogenolysis, and gluconeogenesis. When glycogenesis occurs, glycogenolysis is inhibited, and vice versa. Impaired glycogen metabolism, characterized by abnormal glycogen accumulation, is associated with inherited metabolic disorders and is collectively known as glycogen storage diseases."
Dermatofibroma,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK549820/,"[Bookshelf](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/ ""Bookshelf home"")",Fundamentals (Dermatofibroma),"Glycogenolysis (glycogen metabolism) is initiated by the action of an enzyme known as phosphorylase. Phosphorylase catalyzes the phosphorolytic cleavage of α 1→ 4 linkage to produce glucose-1-P. The liver and muscle both contain the enzyme phosphorylase. Phosphorylase activity is regulated by phosphorylation; in the phosphorylated form, it is active, and in the non-phosphorylated form, it is inactive. The liver breaks down glycogen during periods of fasting to increase the blood glucose concentration for use as fuel by the body, particularly in the brain and red blood cells."
Dermatofibroma,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK549820/,"[Bookshelf](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/ ""Bookshelf home"")",Steps of Glycogenolysis (Dermatofibroma),"Phosphorylase kinase (PhK) is an enzyme that activates phosphorylase by phosphorylation. Various hormones and neuronal signals stimulate phK by producing the second messengers Ca2+ and cAMP. PhK consists of 4 subunits in a hexadecameric complex (αβγδ). Each PhK subunit has different isoforms or splice variants differentially expressed in human tissues.
Glycogenolysis occurs in the following steps:
1. Activated glycogen phosphorylase breaks the glucosyl α-1→4 linkages and removes by phosphorolytic cleavage the 1→4 glucosyl residues from the outermost chains of the glycogen molecule until approximately 4 glucose residues remain on either side of an α-1→6 branch. It should be noted that phosphorylase activity produces glucose in the form of glucose-1-P, not as free glucose.
2. When 4 glucose residues are left from the branch point, then another enzyme, α-1,4 →α-1,4 glucan transferase transfers a trisaccharide unit from one side to the other, exposing α-1→6 branch point.
3. A specific debranching enzyme (amylo-1→6-glucosidase) hydrolyzes α-1→6 glucosidic linkage. This reaction produces 1 free glucose molecule.
4. The combined action of phosphorylase and other enzymes convert glycogen to glucose-1-P. Phosphoglucomutase enzyme transfers a phosphate group on an α-D-glucose monomer from the 1 to the 6 position in the forward or opposite direction.

In the liver and kidney, glucose-6-phosphatase is present, which removes the phosphate group from glucose-6-P, forming free glucose. Free glucose diffuses to the extracellular space, marking the final step of hepatic glycogenolysis and increasing blood glucose levels.
In muscles, the enzyme glucose-6-phosphatase is absent. Therefore, glucose-6-P enters into the glycolytic cycle and forms pyruvate and lactic acid. But indirectly, lactic acid can serve as an intermediate molecule for glucose formation in the liver. Muscle glycogen cannot provide blood glucose by glycogenolysis due to a lack of the enzyme glucose-6-phosphatase."
Dermatofibroma,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK549820/,"[Bookshelf](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/ ""Bookshelf home"")",Mechanism (Dermatofibroma),"The enzymes glycogen synthase and glycogen phosphorylase regulate the balance of glycogen metabolism. Glycogenesis responds to hormonal control and second messenger signals. One of the primary forms of control is the varied phosphorylation of glycogen synthase and glycogen phosphorylase. Enzymes under hormonal control regulate phosphorylation, and there are many different effectors compared to allosteric regulation systems.
Corresponding to cytosolic degradation, glycogen phosphorylase, the rate-limiting enzyme of glycogenolysis, cleaves terminal glucose residue connected to a glycogen branch while substituting a phosphoryl group for the α-1-4 bond. Four residues before an α-1-6 bond, corresponding to a branch, glycogen debranching enzyme catalyzes the transfer of 3 of the 4 remaining glucose residues to the end of another glycogen chain, which can be degraded by glycogen phosphorylase. In other words, the breakage of α-1-4 glycosidic bonds present in linear chains is catalyzed by glycogen phosphorylase, and the addition of the phosphate group to position 1 results in the production of glucose-1-phosphate.
The activity of glycogen phosphorylase is modulated allosterically and by phosphorylation. Glycogen production, conversely, inhibits glycogen degradation. Phosphoglucomutase is in charge of converting glucose-1-phosphate to glucose-6-phosphate through an isomerization reaction that has no energy requirements. On the other hand, the debranching enzyme deals with α-1-6 bonds and transfers a branch to the end of the polymer so that glycogen phosphorylase can continue working. In most tissues, glucose-6-phosphate is used for glycolysis and energy production. It is also a critical metabolic intermediate for other pathways, including the TCA cycle, fatty acid synthesis, Cori cycle, and alanine cycle.
Blood glucose level is maintained within physiological limits of 60 mg% to 100 mg% in fasting state and 100 mg% to 140 mg% following ingestion of a carbohydrate-containing meal by a balance between 2 sets of features: (A) rate of glucose entry into the bloodstream and (B) rate of glucose removal from the bloodstream."
Dermatofibroma,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK549820/,"[Bookshelf](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/ ""Bookshelf home"")",Pathophysiology (Dermatofibroma),"Impaired glycogenolysis can lead to a variety of diseases, including glycogen storage diseases (GSDs), lysosomal storage diseases, and Lafora progressive myoclonus epilepsy. Disruptions in glycogenolysis frequently affect the function of organs, including the liver, skeletal muscle, brain, and kidney. Depending on the affected enzyme in glycogenolysis, a spectrum of syndromes is possible.
Glycogen storage disease Type V, McArdle disease, develops due to a skeletal muscle glycogen phosphorylase deficiency. Patients display exercise intolerance, muscle weakness, cramping, and pain. Creatine kinase levels are elevated, and myoglobinuria can also develop. A typical symptom of McArdle disease is second wind, where patients can resume exercise when resting briefly. Ingestion of sucrose before exercise can help alleviate symptoms since this becomes the energy source during exercise before resorting to glycogen stores."
Dermatofibroma,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK549820/,"[Bookshelf](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/ ""Bookshelf home"")",Clinical Significance (Dermatofibroma),"Glycogenolysis plays a central role in regulating glucose levels in the blood. In muscle cells, glycogenolysis delivers an immediate source of glucose-6-P for glycolysis, which provides energy for muscle contraction. Impaired glycogenolysis is associated with various inherited metabolic disorders, collectively known as glycogen storage diseases."

Dermatofibroma,https://www.dermnetnz.org/topics/dermatofibrosarcoma-protuberans,**Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans**,What is dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans? (Dermatofibroma),"Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans is an uncommon skin tumour arising in the deeper layer of the skin (the dermis). It grows slowly but has a tendency to recur after excision. Luckily, it rarely spreads to other sites beyond the skin.

Dermatofibroma,https://www.dermnetnz.org/topics/dermatofibrosarcoma-protuberans,**Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans**,What causes dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans? (Dermatofibroma),"The cause of dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans is unknown, but an injury to the affected skin may be a predisposing factor. Recent advances show tumour cells carry abnormal chromosomes within the tumour cells—t(17;22)(q22;q13)—resulting in the fusion gene _COL1A1-PDGFB_. This encodes a protein that causes a tumour to grow by autocrine overproduction of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)."
Dermatofibroma,https://www.dermnetnz.org/topics/dermatofibrosarcoma-protuberans,**Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans**,Who is at risk of dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans? (Dermatofibroma),"Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans is rare and affects less than 1 person in every 100,000 inhabitants per year.
* It usually presents in early or middle adult life between 20 and 59 years of age, but all ages can be affected. The tumour is rare in children.
* Males are affected slightly more frequently than females.
* There does not appear to be any racial predilection"
Dermatofibroma,https://www.dermnetnz.org/topics/dermatofibrosarcoma-protuberans,**Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans**,What are the signs and symptoms of dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans? (Dermatofibroma),"Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans usually presents as a painless thickened area of skin (plaque) and/or nodule that feels rubbery or firm to touch and is fixed to the underlying skin. It may be red-brown or skin coloured. It usually grows very slowly over months to years.
Rarely it presents as a soft depressed area of the skin making the diagnosis even more difficult. Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans may range in size from 0.5–25 cm in diameter. Fifty to sixty per cent of tumours arise on the trunk, often in the shoulder and chest area. The remaining 35% of tumours are found on the limbs and 10 to 15% on the head and neck region.
Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans is often diagnosed when it enters a more rapid growth phase giving rise to larger lesions. Neglected tumours may reach large proportions.

Dermatofibroma,https://www.dermnetnz.org/topics/dermatofibrosarcoma-protuberans,**Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans**,How is dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans diagnosed? (Dermatofibroma),"Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans's chromosomal abnormalities can be detected using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or fluorescence in-situ hybridisation (FISH).
In most cases of dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, no other investigations are necessary. If there is suspicion of metastasis or there is fibrosarcomatous transformation, lymph node ultrasound, chest X-ray and pelvic ultrasound scan may be arranged."
Dermatofibroma,https://www.dermnetnz.org/topics/dermatofibrosarcoma-protuberans,**Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans**,What is the treatment for dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans? (Dermatofibroma),"Treatment of dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans and dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans with fibrosarcomatous transformation consists of wide excision of the lesion including deep fascia, with 1–3 cm margin of normal skin. It may take more than one surgical procedure to ensure complete removal of a tumour.
Mohs micrographic surgery, which is a special surgical technique to control tumour margins, is sometimes used to check that all the abnormal cells have been excised. Recurrence after Mohs surgery is reported to be around 1%."
Dermatofibroma,https://www.dermnetnz.org/topics/dermatofibrosarcoma-protuberans,**Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans**,What is the prognosis for dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans? (Dermatofibroma),"Follow-up with clinical examination of the site of the dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans is recommended every 6 months for 5 years, and then annually.
The tumour only metastasises in 5% of cases. It spreads in 1% via lymphatic vessels to the regional lymph glands and in 4% via the bloodstream, most commonly to the lung followed by the brain, bone and heart.
Local recurrences arise in 11–20% of cases, usually within 3 years of initial surgery, so follow-up is important. The recurrences are treated surgically as described for the original primary tumour."

Upon the entry, the viral particle is uncoded and ready for translation ORF 1a and 1b into polyproteins pp1a (4382 amino acids) and pp1ab (7073 amino acids) that are processed by proteases 3-C-like protease (3CLpro) and papain-like protease (PLpro). Subsequently, these polyproteins are cleaved into at least 15 non-structural proteins (nsp), which assembles and form the replication-transcription complex. With the aid of replicases, the full-length positive strand of genomic RNA is transcribed to form a full-length negative-strand template for the synthesis of new genomic RNAs. These mRNAs are then transcribed and translated to produce the structural and accessory proteins.

Therefore, interrupting any stages of the viral life cycle would become a potential therapeutic target for developing antiviral therapies. Although numerous anti-human coronaviral agents have been identified through various approaches, no specific treatment is currently available for HCoVs, to date. One of the main reasons for that is most of the identified agents were not properly evaluated for _in vitro_ and _in vivo_ studies.
Our increasing understanding of novel emerging coronaviruses will be accompanied by increasing opportunities for the reasonable design of therapeutics. Importantly, understanding this basic information about coronavirus protease targets will not only aid the public health against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV but also help in advance to target new coronaviruses that may emerge in the future.
In spite of huge efforts taken by both academia and pharmaceutical industries, no coronavirus protease inhibitor has yet successfully been marketed."
